The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly         • Prof. Bolin, the Chairman of the IPCC, for his able leadership and
established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United        skilful guidance of the IPCC;
Nations Environment Programme in 1988, in order to: (i) assess avail-    • the Vice-Chairmen of the IPCC, Prof. Yu. A. Izrael (Russian
able scientific information on climate change, (ii) assess the             Federation) and Dr A. Al-Gain (Saudi Arabia);
environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and
                                                                         • the Co-Chairmen of Working Group I, Dr L.G. Meira Filho (Brazil)
(iii) formulate response strategies. The IPCC First Assessment Report

In 1992, the Panel reorganized its Working Groups II and III to            Dr S. K. Sharma (India), Mr H. Tsukamoto (Japan), Prof. P. Vellinga

social and economic aspects of climate change. It committed itself         later Dr J. Friaa (Tunisia) and Ing. (Mrs) M. Perdomo (Venezuela);
to completing its Second Assessment in 1995, not only updating the       • the Co-Chairmen of Working Group III, Dr J.P. Bruce (Canada) and
information on the same range of topics as in the First Assessment,        Dr Hoesung Lee (Republic of Korea); the Vice-Chairmen of the
but also including the new subject area of technical issues related to     Working Group, Prof. R. Odingo (Kenya) and Dr T. Hanisch and
the socio-economic aspects of climate change. We applaud the IPCC          later Dr L. Lorentsen (Norway);
for producing its Second Assessment Report (SAR) as scheduled. We

are convinced that the SAR, as the earlier IPCC reports, would
