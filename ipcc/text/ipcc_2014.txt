The timing of the SYR, which was released on 2nd November 2014 in

at the 20th Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to prepare the groundwork
for the 21st Session in 2015 in Paris, when they have been tasked with

                                                 Stephen H. Schneider
                                               (11 February 1945 – 19 July 2010)




 The Synthesis Report of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is dedicated to
 the memory of Stephen H. Schneider, one of the foremost climate scientists of our time.

 Steve Schneider, born in New York, trained as a plasma physicist, embraced scholarship in the field of climate science almost
 40 years ago and continued his relentless efforts creating new knowledge in the field and informing policymakers and the public
 at large on the growing problem of climate change and solutions for dealing with it. At all times Steve Schneider remained
 intrepid and forthright in expressing his views. His convictions were driven by the strength of his outstanding scientific expertise.
 He was highly respected as Founding Editor of the interdisciplinary journal Climatic Change and authored hundreds of books and
 papers, many of which were co-authored with scientists from diverse disciplines. His association with the IPCC began with the
 First Assessment Report which was published in 1990, and which played a major role in the scientific foundation of the UN Frame-
 work Convention on Climate Change. Subsequently, he was Lead Author, Coordinating Lead Author and Expert Reviewer for
 various Assessment Reports and a member of the Core Writing Team for the Synthesis Report of the Fourth Assessment Report.
 His life and accomplishments have inspired and motivated members of the Core Writing Team of this Report. Steve Schneider’s
 knowledge was a rare synthesis of several disciplines which are an essential part of the diversity inherent in climate science.

            Introduction
            This Synthesis Report is based on the reports of the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
            (IPCC), including relevant Special Reports. It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC’s
            Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

SPM         This summary follows the structure of the longer report which addresses the following topics: Observed changes and their
            causes; Future climate change, risks and impacts; Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development;
            Adaptation and mitigation.

            In the Synthesis Report, the certainty in key assessment findings is communicated as in the Working Group Reports and
            Special Reports. It is based on the author teams’ evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a
            qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood
            (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain)1. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact with-
            out using uncertainty qualifiers.

            This report includes information relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
            (UNFCCC).


            SPM 1.		           Observed Changes and their Causes

                  Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-
                  house gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts
                  on human and natural systems. {1}


            SPM 1.1		          Observed changes in the climate system


                  Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed
                  changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have
                  warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. {1.1}


            Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The
            period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where
            such assessment is possible (medium confidence). The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature
            data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple
            independently produced datasets exist (Figure SPM.1a). {1.1.1, Figure 1.1}

            In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and
            interannual variability (Figure SPM.1a). Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the
            beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over

                Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. In many cases, a synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an
                assignment of confidence. The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are low, medium or high. A level of
                confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The follow-
                ing terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%,

      Summary for Policymakers




            the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15] °C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the
            rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per decade). {1.1.1, Box 1.1}

            Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy
            accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence), with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale,
            the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the
SPM         period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed
            between the 1870s and 1971. {1.1.2, Figure 1.2}

            Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium
            confidence before and high confidence after 1951). For other latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends
            have low confidence. Observations of changes in ocean surface salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the
            global water cycle over the ocean (medium confidence). It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation dom-
            inates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since
            the 1950s. {1.1.1, 1.1.2}

            Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean
            surface water has decreased by 0.1 (high confidence), corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion
            concentration. {1.1.2}

            Over the period 1992 to 2011, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high confidence), likely at a
            larger rate over 2002 to 2011. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide (high confidence). Northern Hemisphere
            spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent (high confidence). There is high confidence that permafrost tempera-
            tures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow
            cover. {1.1.3}

            The annual mean Arctic sea-ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012, with a rate that was very likely in the range
            3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with
            the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer (high confidence). It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic
            sea-ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence
            that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others.
            {1.1.3, Figure 1.1}

            Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m (Figure SPM.1b). The rate of sea level rise
            since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). {1.1.4,
            Figure 1.1}


            SPM 1.2		      Causes of climate change

                 Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven
                 largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmo-
                 spheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in
                 at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic driv-
                 ers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been
                 the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. {1.2, 1.3.1}


            Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in the atmospheric
            concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Figure SPM.1c). Between 1750 and 2011,
            cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were 2040 ± 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have
            remained in the atmosphere (880 ± 35 GtCO2); the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land (in plants and
            soils) and in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification.
            About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years (high confidence)
            (Figure SPM.1d). {1.2.1, 1.2.2}

Figure SPM.2 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970
to 2010 by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide
(N2O); fluorinated gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO2-equivalent emission
weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and AR5 values. Unless otherwise stated, CO2-equivalent emissions in this report include the
basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the SAR (see Glos-
sary). Using the most recent GWP100 values from the AR5 (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) from an
increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend significantly. {Figure 1.6, Box 3.2}



Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between
2000 and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 have
reached 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78%
of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the
period 2000 to 2010 (high confidence) (Figure SPM.2). Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most
important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between
2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has
risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization (i.e., reducing the carbon
intensity of energy) of the world’s energy supply (high confidence). {1.2.2}

The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It is
extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was
caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate
of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period (Figure SPM.3). Anthro-
pogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century
over every continental region except Antarctica4. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since
1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice
sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely
made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0–700 m) and to global mean sea level rise
observed since the 1970s. {1.3, Figure 1.10}




3                       Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified as CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) emissions using weightings based on the 100-year Global Warming Potentials,
                        using IPCC Second Assessment Report values unless otherwise stated. {Box 3.2}
4                       For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming aver-
                        aged over available stations.

            The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution of an
            individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the combined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty
            than the contributions from greenhouse gases and from other anthropogenic forcings separately. This is because these two contributions partially compen-
            sate, resulting in a combined signal that is better constrained by observations. {Figure 1.9}



            SPM 1.3		         Impacts of climate change


                  In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on
                  all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespec-
                  tive of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate.
                  {1.3.2}




            Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. In many regions,
            changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of
            quantity and quality (medium confidence). Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic
            ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change
            (high confidence). Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor
            contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences (Figure SPM.4). Assessment of many studies covering
            a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common
            than positive impacts (high confidence). Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to
            human influence (medium confidence). {1.3.2}

Figure SPM.4 | Based on the available scientific literature since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), there are substantially more impacts in recent
decades now attributed to climate change. Attribution requires defined scientific evidence on the role of climate change. Absence from the map of addi-
tional impacts attributed to climate change does not imply that such impacts have not occurred. The publications supporting attributed impacts reflect a
growing knowledge base, but publications are still limited for many regions, systems and processes, highlighting gaps in data and studies. Symbols indicate
categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact and confidence in attribution. Each
symbol refers to one or more entries in WGII Table SPM.A1, grouping related regional-scale impacts. Numbers in ovals indicate regional totals of climate
change publications from 2001 to 2010, based on the Scopus bibliographic database for publications in English with individual countries mentioned in title,
abstract or key words (as of July 2011). These numbers provide an overall measure of the available scientific literature on climate change across regions;
they do not indicate the number of publications supporting attribution of climate change impacts in each region. Studies for polar regions and small islands
are grouped with neighbouring continental regions. The inclusion of publications for assessment of attribution followed IPCC scientific evidence criteria
defined in WGII Chapter 18. Publications considered in the attribution analyses come from a broader range of literature assessed in the WGII AR5. See WGII
Table SPM.A1 for descriptions of the attributed impacts. {Figure 1.11}

      Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold tem-
      perature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea
      levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. {1.4}


It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased
on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is



                                                                                                                                                                                  7
      Summary for Policymakers




            very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of
            daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the prob-
            ability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased
            heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions. {1.4}

            There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased.
SPM         Recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of
            flooding at regional scale (medium confidence). It is likely that extreme sea levels (for example, as experienced in storm
            surges) have increased since 1970, being mainly a result of rising mean sea level. {1.4}

            Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant
            vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high confi-
            dence). {1.4}




            SPM 2.		          Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts

                  Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting
                  changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe,
                  pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would
                  require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together
                  with adaptation, can limit climate change risks. {2}




            SPM 2.1		         Key drivers of future climate


                  Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late
                  21st century and beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary over a wide range,
                  depending on both socio-economic development and climate policy. {2.1}


            Anthropogenic GHG emissions are mainly driven by population size, economic activity, lifestyle, energy use, land use patterns,
            technology and climate policy. The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used for making projections
            based on these factors, describe four different 21st century pathways of GHG emissions and atmospheric concentrations,
            air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios
            (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to
            constrain emissions (’baseline scenarios’) lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Figure SPM.5a). RCP2.6 is
            representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The RCPs
            are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the literature as assessed by WGIII5. {2.1, Box 2.2, 4.3}

            Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong, consistent, almost linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and
            projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in both the RCPs and the wider set of mitigation scenarios analysed
            in WGIII (Figure SPM.5b). Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions6, and therefore,
            e.g., higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later. {2.2.5, Table 2.2}




            5   Roughly 300 baseline scenarios and 900 mitigation scenarios are categorized by CO2-equivalent concentration (CO2-eq) by 2100. The CO2-eq includes
                the forcing due to all GHGs (including halogenated gases and tropospheric ozone), aerosols and albedo change.
            6   Quantification of this range of CO2 emissions requires taking into account non-CO2 drivers.

      Summary for Policymakers




            Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with
            a probability of >66%7 would require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to remain below
            about 2900 GtCO2 (with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 drivers). About 1900 GtCO28 had already been
            emitted by 2011. For additional context see Table 2.2. {2.2.5}

            SPM 2.2           Projected changes in the climate system

                  Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission
                  scenarios. It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that
                  extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions. The
                  ocean will continue to warm and acidify, and global mean sea level to rise. {2.2}


            The projected changes in Section SPM 2.2 are for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, unless otherwise indicated.

            Future climate will depend on committed warming caused by past anthropogenic emissions, as well as future anthropogenic
            emissions and natural climate variability. The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016–2035 relative to
            1986–2005 is similar for the four RCPs and will likely be in the range 0.3°C to 0.7°C (medium confidence). This assumes that
            there will be no major volcanic eruptions or changes in some natural sources (e.g., CH4 and N2O), or unexpected changes in
            total solar irradiance. By mid-21st century, the magnitude of the projected climate change is substantially affected by the
            choice of emissions scenario. {2.2.1, Table 2.1}

            Relative to 1850–1900, global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) is projected to likely
            exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5
            (high confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5 (medium confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6
            (medium confidence). {2.2.1}

            The increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) relative to 1986–2005 is likely
            to be 0.3°C to 1.7°C under RCP2.6, 1.1°C to 2.6°C under RCP4.5, 1.4°C to 3.1°C under RCP6.0 and 2.6°C to 4.8°C under
            RCP8.59. The Arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean (Figure SPM.6a, Figure SPM.7a). {2.2.1,
            Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2, Table 2.1}

            It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily
            and seasonal timescales, as global mean surface temperature increases. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a
            higher frequency and longer duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. {2.2.1}

                (range of 2950 to 3800 GtCO2) respectively. Higher or lower temperature limits would imply larger or lower cumulative emissions respectively.
            8
                This corresponds to about two thirds of the 2900 GtCO2 that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >66%; to about 63% of the total
                amount of 3000 GtCO2 that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >50%; and to about 58% of the total amount of 3300 GtCO2
                that would limit warming to less than 2°C with a probability of >33%.
            9   The period 1986–2005 is approximately 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C warmer than 1850–1900. {2.2.1}

Figure SPM.6 | Global average surface temperature change (a) and global mean sea level rise10 (b) from 2006 to 2100 as determined by multi-model
simulations. All changes are relative to 1986–2005. Time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6
(blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over 2081–2100 are given for all RCP scenarios as coloured vertical bars at the
right hand side of each panel. The number of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models used to calculate the multi-model mean is
indicated. {2.2, Figure 2.1}



Changes in precipitation will not be uniform. The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific are likely to experience an increase
in annual mean precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipi-
tation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5
scenario (Figure SPM.7b). Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical
regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent. {2.2.2, Figure 2.2}

The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century, with the strongest warming projected for the surface in
tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions (Figure SPM.7a). {2.2.3, Figure 2.2}




10   Based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic
     ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium confidence
     that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century.

            Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with
            a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07 (15 to 17%
            increase in acidity) for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 (38 to 41%) for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 (58 to 62%) for RCP6.0 and 0.30 to 0.32

            Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. A nearly ice-free11 Arctic Ocean in the summer sea-
            ice minimum in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.512 (medium confidence). {2.2.3, Figure 2.1}

            It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface
            temperature increases, with the area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) projected to decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to

There has been significant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Global mean sea
level rise will continue during the 21st century, very likely at a faster rate than observed from 1971 to 2010. For the period
2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, the rise will likely be in the ranges of 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, and of 0.45 to 0.82 m
for RCP8.5 (medium confidence)10 (Figure SPM.6b). Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the
21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. About 70% of the coastlines
worldwide are projected to experience a sea level change within ±20% of the global mean. {2.2.3}

SPM 2.3		         Future risks and impacts caused by a changing climate


      Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human sys-
      tems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and
      communities in countries at all levels of development. {2.3}


Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and
trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and
magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk
of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual
regions (Figure SPM.8), while others are global. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting
the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to
trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds increases with
rising temperature (medium confidence). For risk assessment, it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts,
including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {1.5, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, Box Introduction.1, Box 2.3, Box 2.4}

A large fraction of species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and beyond the 21st century, espe-
cially as climate change interacts with other stressors (high confidence). Most plant species cannot naturally shift their
geographical ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes;
most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above
in flat landscapes in this century (high confidence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global
climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species
extinctions during the past millions of years. Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high rates and
magnitudes of ocean acidification (high confidence), with associated risks exacerbated by rising ocean temperature extremes
(medium confidence). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at
risk from sea level rise, which will continue for centuries even if the global mean temperature is stabilized (high confidence).
{2.3, 2.4, Figure 2.5}

Climate change is projected to undermine food security (Figure SPM.9). Due to projected climate change by the mid-21st century
and beyond, global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained
provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services (high confidence). For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temper-
ate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases
of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may benefit (medium confidence). Global tem-
perature increases of ~4°C or more13 above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose
large risks to food security globally (high confidence). Climate change is projected to reduce renewable surface water and
groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement), intensifying competition for water
among sectors (limited evidence, medium agreement). {2.3.1, 2.3.2}

     Projected warming averaged over land is larger than global average warming for all RCP scenarios for the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005.

     very low, low, medium, high or very high. Risk levels are presented for three time frames: present, near term (here, for 2030–2040) and long term (here, for 2080–2100). In the near term, projected
     levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels are presented for two possible futures (2°C and 4°C global
     mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels). For each timeframe, risk levels are indicated for a continuation of current adaptation and assuming high levels of current or future adaptation.
     Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions. {Figure 2.4}

          or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation.

Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already
exist (very high confidence). Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many
regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high
confidence). By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is
expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors (high confidence). {2.3.2}

In urban areas climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks
from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scar-
city, sea level rise and storm surges (very high confidence). These risks are amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure
and services or living in exposed areas. {2.3.2}

                                                                                                                                                                            15
      Summary for Policymakers




            Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and
            agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high confidence).
            {2.3.2}

            Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic
            impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are
SPM         projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong
            existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confi-
            dence). International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of
            climate change at regional scales. {2.3.2}

            Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Populations that lack
            the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, particularly in developing coun-
            tries with low income. Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers
            of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). {2.3.2}




            SPM 2.4		      Climate change beyond 2100, irreversibility and abrupt changes


                 Many aspects of climate change and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if
                 anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible
                 changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. {2.4}


            Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately
            constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A large frac-
            tion of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale,
            except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period. {2.4, Figure 2.8}

            Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting
            biomes, soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales
            which will result in changes lasting hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature is stabilized. {2.1, 2.4}

            There is high confidence that ocean acidification will increase for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, and will strongly affect
            marine ecosystems. {2.4}

            It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise
            dependent on future emissions. The threshold for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, and an asso-
            ciated sea level rise of up to 7 m, is greater than about 1°C (low confidence) but less than about 4°C (medium confidence)
            of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is
            possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment. {2.4}

            Magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios pose an increased risk of
            abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater
            ecosystems, including wetlands (medium confidence). A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise
            in global temperatures. {2.4}

SPM 3.		       Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development

     Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks
     of climate change. Substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce cli-
     mate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce
     the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to climate-resilient                                      SPM
     pathways for sustainable development. {3.2, 3.3, 3.4}


SPM 3.1		      Foundations of decision-making about climate change


     Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide
     range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the
     importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assess-
     ments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. {3.1}


Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is
necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contri-
butions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circum-
stances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity,
justice and fairness. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emis-
sions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging
impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change
that are consistent with sustainable development take into account the co-benefits, adverse side effects and risks that may
arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. {3.1, 3.5, Box 3.4}

The design of climate policy is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take
them into account. Methods of valuation from economic, social and ethical analysis are available to assist decision-making.
These methods can take account of a wide range of possible impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large conse-
quences. But they cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. {3.1}

Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate
over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent (e.g., individual, community, company, country) affect other agents.
Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Cooperative responses,
including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate
change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including
international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.
{3.1}


SPM 3.2		      Climate change risks reduced by mitigation and adaptation

     Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation,
     warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, wide-
     spread and irreversible impacts globally (high confidence). Mitigation involves some level
     of co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve the
     same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change,
     increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. {3.2, 3.4}

Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts over different time-
scales (high confidence). Mitigation, in the near term and through the century, can substantially reduce climate change



                                                                                                                                   17

            impacts in the latter decades of the 21st century and beyond. Benefits from adaptation can already be realized in addressing
            current risks, and can be realized in the future for addressing emerging risks. {3.2, 4.5}

            Five Reasons For Concern (RFCs) aggregate climate change risks and illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation
            limits for people, economies and ecosystems across sectors and regions. The five RFCs are associated with: (1) Unique and
            threatened systems, (2) Extreme weather events, (3) Distribution of impacts, (4) Global aggregate impacts, and (5) Large-
SPM         scale singular events. In this report, the RFCs provide information relevant to Article 2 of UNFCCC. {Box 2.4}

            Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the
            21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally (high confidence)
            (Figure SPM.10). In most scenarios without additional mitigation efforts (those with 2100 atmospheric concentrations

            Figure SPM.10 | The relationship between risks from climate change, temperature change, cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and changes in
            annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern (a) would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2 (b)
            which would constrain annual GHG emissions over the next few decades (c). Panel a reproduces the five Reasons For Concern {Box 2.4}. Panel b links
            temperature changes to cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) from 1870. They are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
            simulations (pink plume) and on a simple climate model (median climate response in 2100), for the baselines and five mitigation scenario categories (six
            ellipses). Details are provided in Figure SPM.5. Panel c shows the relationship between the cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) of the scenario catego-
            ries and their associated change in annual GHG emissions by 2050, expressed in percentage change (in percent GtCO2-eq per year) relative to 2010. The
            ellipses correspond to the same scenario categories as in Panel b, and are built with a similar method (see details in Figure SPM.5). {Figure 3.1}

>1000 ppm CO2-eq), warming is more likely than not to exceed 4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 (Table SPM.1). The
risks associated with temperatures at or above 4°C include substantial species extinction, global and regional food insecurity,
consequential constraints on common human activities and limited potential for adaptation in some cases (high confidence).
Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events,
are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. {2.3, Figure 2.5, 3.2, 3.4, Box 2.4, Table SPM.1}

Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting                SPM
warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond. Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean
surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Limiting risks across RFCs would imply a limit for cumulative emissions
of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to zero and would constrain annual
emissions over the next few decades (Figure SPM.10) (high confidence). But some risks from climate damages are unavoid-
able, even with mitigation and adaptation. {2.2.5, 3.2, 3.4}

Mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, wide-
spread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change. Inertia in the economic and climate system and the possibility
of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts (high confidence). Delays
in additional mitigation or constraints on technological options increase the longer-term mitigation costs to hold climate
change risks at a given level (Table SPM.2). {3.2, 3.4}


SPM 3.3		      Characteristics of adaptation pathways


     Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effec-
     tiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-
     term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that
     more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. {3.3}


Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods,
functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific (high confidence). A first step towards
adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability (high confidence).
Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with develop-
ment and disaster risk reduction. Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adapta-
tion options (robust evidence, high agreement). {3.3}

Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to
governments (high confidence). National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national govern-
ments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information,
policy and legal frameworks and financial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the private
sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of commu-
nities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing (medium evidence, high agreement). {3.3}

Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk
perceptions (high confidence). Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can
benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous
peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have
not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing practices increases
the effectiveness of adaptation. {3.3}

Constraints can interact to impede adaptation planning and implementation (high confidence). Common constraints on
implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of gov-
ernance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adapta-
tion leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Another constraint includes insufficient
research, monitoring, and observation and the finance to maintain them. {3.3}



                                                                                                                                   19
      Summary for Policymakers




            Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high confidence).
            Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints.
            Further, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate conse-
            quences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulner-
            ability of other people, places or sectors (medium evidence, high agreement). Underestimating the complexity of adaptation
            as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes. {3.3}
SPM
            Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adap-
            tation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very high confidence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and
            adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water,
            energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of
            actions with co-benefits include (i) improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of
            health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening
            cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and
            other ecosystem services. {3.3}

            Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote
            sustainable development (high confidence). At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects
            a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances
            and priorities. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures, without consider-
            ing transformational change, may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. Planning and implementation of trans-
            formational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and may place new and increased demands
            on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical
            implications. Adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes and innovation. {3.3}


            SPM 3.4		          Characteristics of mitigation pathways


                   There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative
                   to pre-industrial levels. These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over
                   the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases
                   by the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, eco-
                   nomic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation
                   and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves
                   similar challenges but on different timescales. {3.4}


            Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emissions growth is expected to
            persist, driven by growth in global population and economic activities. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100
            in baseline scenarios—those without additional mitigation—range from 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900
            for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty (5th to 95th percentile
            range) (high confidence). {3.4}14

            Emissions scenarios leading to CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain
            warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels15. These scenarios are characterized by 40 to 70%
            global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 201016, and emissions levels near zero or below in
            2100. Mitigation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit
            temperature change to less than 2°C, unless they temporarily overshoot concentration levels of roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq


            15   For comparison, the CO2-eq concentration in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm)
            16   This range differs from the range provided for a similar concentration category in the AR4 (50 to 85% lower than 2000 for CO2 only). Reasons for this
                 difference include that this report has assessed a substantially larger number of scenarios than in the AR4 and looks at all GHGs. In addition, a large
                 proportion of the new scenarios include Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies (see below). Other factors include the use of 2100 concentration
                 levels instead of stabilization levels and the shift in reference year from 2000 to 2010.

before 2100, in which case they are about as likely as not to achieve that goal. In these 500 ppm CO2-eq scenarios, global 2050
emissions levels are 25 to 55% lower than in 2010. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater
reliance on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies beyond mid-century (and vice versa). Trajectories that are likely to
limit warming to 3°C relative to pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming to 2°C. A lim-
ited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are
characterized by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between 70% and 95% below
2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and                                                                                                  SPM

            Notes:
            a
              The ‘total range’ for the 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq concentrations scenarios corresponds to the range of the 10th to 90th percentile of the subcategory of
            these scenarios shown in Table 6.3 of the Working Group III Report.
            b Baseline scenarios fall into the >1000 and 720 to 1000 ppm CO2-eq categories. The latter category also includes mitigation scenarios. The baseline sce-
            narios in the latter category reach a temperature change of 2.5°C to 5.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 in 2100. Together with the baseline scenarios
            in the >1000 ppm CO2-eq category, this leads to an overall 2100 temperature range of 2.5°C to 7.8°C (range based on median climate response: 3.7°C
            to 4.8°C) for baseline scenarios across both concentration categories.
            c
             The global 2010 emissions are 31% above the 1990 emissions (consistent with the historic greenhouse gas emission estimates presented in this report).
            CO2-eq emissions include the basket of Kyoto gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as fluorinated gases).
            d The assessment here involves a large number of scenarios published in the scientific literature and is thus not limited to the Representative Concentration

            Pathways (RCPs). To evaluate the CO2-eq concentration and climate implications of these scenarios, the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas
            Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was used in a probabilistic mode. For a comparison between MAGICC model results and the outcomes of the models
            used in WGI, see WGI 12.4.1.2, 12.4.8 and WGIII 6.3.2.6.
            e
             The assessment in this table is based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII AR5 using MAGICC and the assessment in
            WGI of the uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models. The statements are therefore consistent with the statements in WGI,
            which are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) runs of the RCPs and the assessed uncertainties. Hence, the likelihood
            statements reflect different lines of evidence from both WGs. This WGI method was also applied for scenarios with intermediate concentration levels where
            no CMIP5 runs are available. The likelihood statements are indicative only {WGIII 6.3} and follow broadly the terms used by the WGI SPM for temperature
            projections: likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, and unlikely 0–33%. In addition the term more unlikely
            than likely 0–<50% is used.
            fThe CO2-equivalent concentration (see Glossary) is calculated on the basis of the total forcing from a simple carbon cycle/climate model, MAGICC. The CO2-
            equivalent concentration in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm). This is based on the assessment of total anthropogenic
            radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 in WGI, i.e., 2.3 W/m2, uncertainty range 1.1 to 3.3 W/m2.
            g   The vast majority of scenarios in this category overshoot the category boundary of 480 ppm CO2-eq concentration.
            hFor scenarios in this category, no CMIP5 run or MAGICC realization stays below the respective temperature level. Still, an unlikely assignment is given to
            reflect uncertainties that may not be reflected by the current climate models.
            i Scenarios in the 580 to 650 ppm CO -eq category include both overshoot scenarios and scenarios that do not exceed the concentration level at the high
                                                  2
            end of the category (e.g., RCP4.5). The latter type of scenarios, in general, have an assessed probability of more unlikely than likely to stay below the 2°C
            temperature level, while the former are mostly assessed to have an unlikely probability of staying below this level.
            j
              In these scenarios, global CO2-eq emissions in 2050 are between 70 to 95% below 2010 emissions, and they are between 110 to 120% below 2010
            emissions in 2100.

Figure SPM.12 | The implications of different 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels for the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions
and low-carbon energy upscaling in mitigation scenarios that are at least about as likely as not to keep warming throughout the 21st century below 2°C
relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 CO2-equivalent concentrations of 430 to 530 ppm). The scenarios are grouped according to different emissions levels
by 2030 (coloured in different shades of green). The left panel shows the pathways of GHG emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/
yr) leading to these 2030 levels. The black dot with whiskers gives historic GHG emission levels and associated uncertainties in 2010 as reported in Figure
SPM.2. The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Cancún Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average
annual CO2 emissions reduction rates for the period 2030–2050. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent inter-model
comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emissions change
(sustained over a period of 20 years) and the average annual CO2 emission change between 2000 and 2010 are shown as well. The arrows in the right
panel show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from 2030 to 2050 subject to different 2030 GHG emissions levels. Zero- and
low-carbon energy supply includes renewables, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS
(BECCS). [Note: Only scenarios that apply the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption)
are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions (>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions and scenarios with
2010 emissions significantly outside the historical range are excluded.] {Figure 3.3}


Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep warming below 2°C
relative to pre-industrial levels) typically involve temporary overshoot17 of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios
reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (Table SPM.1). Depending on the level of overshoot,
overshoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture
and storage (BECCS) and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability and scale of these and other CDR
technologies and methods are uncertain and CDR technologies are, to varying degrees, associated with challenges and
risks18. CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where
mitigation is more expensive (high confidence). {3.4, Box 3.3}

Reducing emissions of non-CO2 agents can be an important element of mitigation strategies. All current GHG emissions
and other forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades, although long-term
warming is mainly driven by CO2 emissions. Emissions of non-CO2 forcers are often expressed as ‘CO2-equivalent emissions’,
but the choice of metric to calculate these emissions, and the implications for the emphasis and timing of abatement of the
various climate forcers, depends on application and policy context and contains value judgments. {3.4, Box 3.2}

17        In concentration ‘overshoot’ scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline.
18        CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how
          much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a
          global scale.

            Figure SPM.13 | Global mitigation costs in cost-effective scenarios at different atmospheric concentrations levels in 2100. Cost-effective scenarios
            assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’
            default technology assumptions. Consumption losses are shown relative to a baseline development without climate policy (left panel). The table at the top
            shows percentage points of annualized consumption growth reductions relative to consumption growth in the baseline of 1.6 to 3% per year (e.g., if the
            reduction is 0.06 percentage points per year due to mitigation, and baseline growth is 2.0% per year, then the growth rate with mitigation would be 1.94%
            per year). Cost estimates shown in this table do not consider the benefits of reduced climate change or co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation.
            Estimates at the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inflexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions required in the long
            run to meet these goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise costs. {Figure 3.4}



            Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the
            21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. It will require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions
            from 2030 to 2050; a much more rapid scale-up of low-carbon energy over this period; a larger reliance on CDR in the long
            term; and higher transitional and long-term economic impacts. Estimated global emissions levels in 2020 based on the
            Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective mitigation trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit
            warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, but they do not preclude the option to meet this goal (high confidence)
            (Figure SPM.12, Table SPM.2). {3.4}

            Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions, but
            increase with the stringency of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in
            which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective
            benchmark for estimating macro-economic mitigation costs (Figure SPM.13). Under these assumptions mitigation scenarios
            that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global
            consumption—not including benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitiga-
            tion—of 1 to 4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030, 2 to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050 and 3 to 11% (median: 4.8%) in 2100 relative to
            consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century (Figure SPM.13).
            These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage
            points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6 and 3% per year (high
            confidence). {3.4}

            In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies (such as bioenergy, CCS and their combination BECCS,
            nuclear, wind/solar), mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered. Delaying additional
            mitigation increases mitigation costs in the medium to long term. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C
            over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels if additional mitigation is considerably delayed. Many models could
            not limit likely warming to below 2°C if bioenergy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited (high confidence)
            (Table SPM.2). {3.4}

                                                                                                  2
sured relative to cost-effective mitigation scenarios for the same long-term concentration level.
b Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology

relative to the models’ default technology assumptions.
c
 The range is determined by the central scenarios encompassing the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenario set. Only scenarios with a time horizon
until 2100 are included. Some models that are included in the cost ranges for concentration levels above 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 could not produce associ-
ated scenarios for concentration levels below 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 with assumptions about limited availability of technologies and/or delayed additional
mitigation.
d No CCS: carbon dioxide capture and storage is not included in these scenarios. Nuclear phase out: no addition of nuclear power plants beyond those under

construction, and operation of existing plants until the end of their lifetime. Limited Solar/Wind: a maximum of 20% global electricity generation from solar
and wind power in any year of these scenarios. Limited Bioenergy: a maximum of 100 EJ/yr modern bioenergy supply globally (modern bioenergy used for
heat, power, combinations and industry was around 18 EJ/yr in 2008). EJ = Exajoule = 1018 Joule.
e Percentage increase of net present value of consumption losses in percent of baseline consumption (for scenarios from general equilibrium models) and

abatement costs in percent of baseline gross domestic product (GDP, for scenarios from partial equilibrium models) for the period 2015–2100, discounted
at 5% per year.




Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy
security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience
of the energy system. {4.4.2.2}

Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions
and fuels exist (high confidence). Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for
major exporters (high confidence). The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effects of mitigation on the value of fossil
fuel assets (medium confidence). {4.4.2.2}

Solar Radiation Management (SRM) involves large-scale methods that seek to reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy
in the climate system. SRM is untested and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios. If it were deployed, SRM would

            entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings and has particular governance and ethical implications.
            SRM would not reduce ocean acidification. If it were terminated, there is high confidence that surface temperatures would
            rise very rapidly impacting ecosystems susceptible to rapid rates of change. {Box 3.3}




SPM         SPM 4.		       Adaptation and Mitigation

                 Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single
                 option is sufficient by itself. Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at
                 all scales and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link adaptation and mitiga-
                 tion with other societal objectives. {4}


            SPM 4.1		      Common enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses


                 Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These
                 include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally
                 sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle
                 choices. {4.1}


            Inertia in many aspects of the socio-economic system constrains adaptation and mitigation options (medium evidence, high
            agreement). Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce GHG emis-
            sions and enhance resilience to climate change (very high confidence). {4.1}

            Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by
            livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture (medium evidence, medium agreement). Also, the social acceptability and/or
            effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate
            changes in lifestyles or behaviours. {4.1}

            For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing
            climate change risks (high confidence). Improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in governance can help
            overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction (very high confidence). {4.1}


            SPM 4.2		      Response options for adaptation


                 Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to
                 reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses
                 involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will
                 increase challenges for many adaptation options. {4.2}


            Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sectors and within communities. There is
            increasing recognition of the value of social (including local and indigenous), institutional, and ecosystem-based measures
            and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more
            limited implementation of responses (high confidence). {1.6, 4.2, 4.4.2.1}

            The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change (very high confidence).
            Adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on their context in
            vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning (Table SPM.3). Effective strategies and
            actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans. {4.2}

            SPM 4.3		                                       Response options for mitigation


                                              Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective
                                              if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the green-
                                              house gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and
SPM
                                              enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. {4.3}


            Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus
            on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium confi-
            dence). Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side effects.
            These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. {4.3}

            Emissions ranges for baseline scenarios and mitigation scenarios that limit CO2-equivalent concentrations to low levels
            (about 450 ppm CO2-eq, likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) are shown for different sectors and gases
            in Figure SPM.14. Key measures to achieve such mitigation goals include decarbonizing (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of)
            electricity generation (medium evidence, high agreement) as well as efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in
            order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development (robust evidence, high
            agreement). In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply
            sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels
            between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low‐concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq,
            at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low‐carbon electricity supply
            (comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) including bioenergy with carbon
            dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050,
            and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. {4.3}

            mitigation scenarios (solid colour bars) that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-
            industrial levels). Mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the
            end-use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. The numbers at the
            bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range (upper row: baseline scenarios; lower row: mitigation scenarios), which differs
            across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Emissions ranges for mitigation scenarios include the full portfolio
            of mitigation options; many models cannot reach 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 2100 in the absence of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).
            Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). ‘Net’ agriculture,
            forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities. {4.3, Figure 4.1}

Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more
flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to
carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits. The most cost-effective mitigation options in
forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative
importance across regions; and in agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic
soils (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.3, Figures 4.1, 4.2, Table 4.3}
                                                                                                                                        SPM
Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation
potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium
agreement). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings
measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes. {4.1, 4.3}

     supporting technology development, diffusion and transfer, as well as finance for responses
     to climate change, can complement and enhance the effectiveness of policies that directly
     promote adaptation and mitigation. {4.4}


International cooperation is critical for effective mitigation, even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Adapta-
tion focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across
governance scales, including international cooperation: {3.1, 4.4.1}

•   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on
    addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. Other institutions organized at different levels of gover-
    nance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation. {4.4.1}

•   The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to
    participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms and environmental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agree-
    ment). {4.4.1}

•   Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben-
    efits (medium evidence, medium agreement). Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission
    leakage and increased market liquidity. {4.4.1}

•   International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has received less attention histori-
    cally than mitigation but is increasing and has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at the
    national, sub-national and local level (high confidence). {4.4.1}

There has been a considerable increase in national and sub‐national plans and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation
since the AR4, with an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce
adverse side effects (high confidence): {4.4.2.1, 4.4.2.2}

•   National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement)
    through coordinating actions and providing frameworks and support. While local government and the private sector
    have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation,
    given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information
    and financing (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.4.2.1}

•   Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into planning and decision-
    making, play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation (robust evidence,



                                                                                                                                   29
      Summary for Policymakers




                  high agreement). Examples of institutional approaches to adaptation involving multiple actors include economic options
                  (e.g., insurance, public-private partnerships), laws and regulations (e.g., land-zoning laws) and national and government
                  policies and programmes (e.g., economic diversification). {4.2, 4.4.2.1, Table SPM.3}

            •     In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitiga-
                  tion in a cost-effective way but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as
SPM               well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps
                  that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In some countries, tax-based policies
                  specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the
                  link between GHG emissions and GDP (high confidence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes (although
                  not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation) have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes. {4.4.2.2}

            •     Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective (medium evi-
                  dence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of infor-
                  mation programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions. {4.4.2.2}

            •     Sector-specific mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies (medium evidence, high
                  agreement). Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address sector-specific barriers or market failures and may be
                  bundled in packages of complementary policies. Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political
                  barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among mitigation policies may
                  be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. {4.4.2.2}

            •     Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such
                  as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable energy (RE)
                  policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent
                  years. At the same time, reducing subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions,
                  depending on the social and economic context (high confidence). {4.4.2.2}

            Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to
            human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable
            development. The potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweighs the potential for adverse side effects
            whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land use
            (AFOLU) measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of socie-
            ties to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations (low confidence). These potential adverse side
            effects on energy access can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other
            benefit transfer mechanisms (medium confidence). Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects
            materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementa-
            tion. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified. {4.3, 4.4.2.2, Box 3.4}

            Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) complements other mitigation policies across all scales, from interna-
            tional to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management
            practices (high confidence). Policies exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies can also
            depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {4.4.3}

            Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns (high confidence). For mitigation
            scenarios that stabilize concentrations (without overshoot) in the range of 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 210019, annual invest-
            ments in low carbon electricity supply and energy efficiency in key sectors (transport, industry and buildings) are projected
            in the scenarios to rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate enabling environments,
            the private sector, along with the public sector, can play important roles in financing mitigation and adaptation (medium
            evidence, high agreement). {4.4.4}




            19   This range comprises scenarios that reach 430 to 480 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) and scenarios
                 that reach 480 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (without overshoot: more likely than not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels).

Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing
countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adapta-
tion (medium confidence). There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Potential
synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation have not yet been fully realized (high
confidence). {4.4.4}

SPM 4.5		 Trade-offs, synergies and interactions with sustainable development



     Climate change is a threat to sustainable development. Nonetheless, there are many opportu-
     nities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through inte-
     grated responses (high confidence). Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suit-
     able governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond (medium confidence). {3.5, 4.5}



Climate change exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor
(high confidence). Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation
(high confidence). Delaying global mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation in
the future. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increas-
ing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity
(medium evidence, high agreement). {3.1, 3.5, 4.5}

Strategies and actions can be pursued now which will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development,
while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental manage-
ment. In some cases, economic diversification can be an important element of such strategies. The effectiveness of integrated
responses can be enhanced by relevant tools, suitable governance structures and adequate institutional and human capacity
(medium confidence). Integrated responses are especially relevant to energy planning and implementation; interactions
among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration; and urban planning, which provides substantial opportu-
nities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development (medium confidence). {3.5, 4.4, 4.5}

                    Box Introduction.1 | Risk and the Management of an Uncertain Future

                    Climate change exposes people, societies, economic sectors and ecosystems to risk. Risk is the potential for consequences when some-
                    thing of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. {WGII SPM Background Box SPM.2, WGIII
                    2.1, SYR Glossary}

                    Risks from climate change impacts arise from the interaction between hazard (triggered by an event or trend related to climate
                    change), vulnerability (susceptibility to harm) and exposure (people, assets or ecosystems at risk). Hazards include processes that range
                    from brief events, such as severe storms, to slow trends, such as multi-decade droughts or multi-century sea level rise. Vulnerability
                    and exposure are both sensitive to a wide range of social and economic processes, with possible increases or decreases depending
                    on development pathways. Risks and co-benefits also arise from policies that aim to mitigate climate change or to adapt to it. (1.5)

                    Risk is often represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the magnitude of the conse-
                    quences if these events occur. Therefore, high risk can result not only from high probability outcomes but also from low probability out-
                    comes with very severe consequences. This makes it important to assess the full range of possible outcomes, from low probability tail
                    outcomes to very likely outcomes. For example, it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century,
                    but the consequence of a greater rise could be so severe that this possibility becomes a significant part of risk assessment. Similarly,
                    low confidence but high consequence outcomes are also policy relevant; for instance the possibility that the response of Amazon forest
                    could substantially amplify climate change merits consideration despite our currently imperfect ability to project the outcome. (2.4,
                    Table 2.3) {WGI Table 13.5, WGII SPM A-3, 4.4, Box 4-3, WGIII Box 3-9, SYR Glossary}

                    Risk can be understood either qualitatively or quantitatively. It can be reduced and managed using a wide range of formal or informal
                    tools and approaches that are often iterative. Useful approaches for managing risk do not necessarily require that risk levels can be
                    accurately quantified. Approaches recognizing diverse qualitative values, goals and priorities, based on ethical, psychological, cultural
                    or social factors, could increase the effectiveness of risk management. {WGII 1.1.2, 2.4, 2.5, 19.3, WGIII 2.4, 2.5, 3.4}

    Box Introduction.2 | Communicating the Degree of Certainty in Assessment Findings

    An integral feature of IPCC reports is the communication of the strength of and uncertainties in scientific understanding underlying
    assessment findings. Uncertainty can result from a wide range of sources. Uncertainties in the past and present are the result of limita-




                                                                                                                                                                                             Introduction
    tions of available measurements, especially for rare events, and the challenges of evaluating causation in complex or multi-component
    processes that can span physical, biological and human systems. For the future, climate change involves changing likelihoods of diverse
    outcomes. Many processes and mechanisms are well understood, but others are not. Complex interactions among multiple climatic and
    non-climatic influences changing over time lead to persistent uncertainties, which in turn lead to the possibility of surprises. Compared
    to past IPCC reports, the AR5 assesses a substantially larger knowledge base of scientific, technical and socio-economic literature.
    {WGI 1.4, WGII SPM A-3, 1.1.2, WGIII 2.3}

    The IPCC Guidance Note on Uncertainty a defines a common approach to evaluating and communicating the degree of certainty in
    findings of the assessment process. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. In many cases, a
    synthesis of evidence and agreement supports an assignment of confidence, especially for findings with stronger agreement and mul-
    tiple independent lines of evidence. The degree of certainty in each key finding of the assessment is based on the type, amount, quality
    and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.
    The summary terms for evidence are: limited, medium or robust. For agreement, they are low, medium or high. Levels of confidence
    include five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and are typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The likelihood, or
    probability, of some well-defined outcome having occurred or occurring in the future can be described quantitatively through the follo-
    wing terms: virtually certain, 99–100% probability; extremely likely, 95–100%; very likely, 90–100%; likely, 66–100%; more likely than
    not, >50–100%; about as likely as not, 33–66%; unlikely, 0–33%; very unlikely, 0–10%; extremely unlikely, 0–5%; and exceptionally
    unlikely, 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely, 95–100%; more likely than not, >50–100%; more unlikely than likely, 0–<50%;
    and extremely unlikely, 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. Unless
    otherwise indicated, findings assigned a likelihood term are associated with high or very high confidence. Where appropriate, findings
    are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. {WGI SPM B, WGII Background Box SPM.3, WGIII 2.1}

    Topic 1: Observed Changes and their Causes

           Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest
           in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.


    Topic 1 focuses on observational evidence of a changing climate, the impacts caused by this change and the human contributions to it. It discusses
    observed changes in climate (1.1) and external influences on climate (forcings), differentiating those forcings that are of anthropogenic origin,
    and their contributions by economic sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs) (1.2). Section 1.3 attributes observed climate change to its causes
    and attributes impacts on human and natural systems to climate change, determining the degree to which those impacts can be attributed to
    climate change. The changing probability of extreme events and their causes are discussed in Section 1.4, followed by an account of exposure
    and vulnerability within a risk context (1.5) and a section on adaptation and mitigation experience (1.6).

                                                                                                                                                                                             Introduction
  The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012,
  is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal
  variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium confidence). The rate of warming of the
  observed global mean surface temperature over the period from 1998 to 2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend
  over the period from 1951 to 2012 (Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1c). Even with this reduction in surface warming trend, the climate system has
  very likely continued to accumulate heat since 1998 (Figure 1.2) and sea level has continued to rise (Figure 1.1). {WGI SPM D.1, Box 9.2}

  The radiative forcing of the climate system has continued to increase during the 2000s, as has its largest contributor, the atmospheric
  concentration of CO2. However, the radiative forcing has been increasing at a lower rate over the period from 1998 to 2011, compared to
  1984 to 1998 or 1951 to 2011, due to cooling effects from volcanic eruptions and the cooling phase of the solar cycle over the period from
  2000 to 2009. There is, however, low confidence in quantifying the role of the forcing trend in causing the reduction in the rate of surface
  warming. {WGI 8.5.2, Box 9.2}
                                                                                                                                                                                               1
  For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the
  observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). There is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial
  degree caused by natural internal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally
  forced warming trend (compare Box 1.1, Figures 1a and 1b; during the period from 1984 to 1998, most model simulations show a smaller
  warming trend than observed). Natural internal variability thus diminishes the relevance of short trends for long-term climate change. The
  difference between models and observations may also contain contributions from inadequacies in the solar, volcanic and aerosol forcings
  used by the models and, in some models, from an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic
  forcing (the latter dominated by the effects of aerosols). {WGI 2.4.3, Box 9.2, 9.4.1, 10.3.1.1}

  For the longer period from 1951 to 2012, simulated surface warming trends are consistent with the observed trend (very high confidence)
  (Box 1.1, Figure 1c). Furthermore, the independent estimates of radiative forcing, of surface warming and of observed heat storage (the
  latter available since 1970) combine to give a heat budget for the Earth that is consistent with the assessed likely range of equilibrium
  climate sensitivity20(1.5–4.5 ºC)21. The record of observed climate change has thus allowed characterization of the basic properties of the
  climate system that have implications for future warming, including the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response
  (see Topic 2). {WGI Box 9.2, 10.8.1, 10.8.2, Box 12.2, Box 13.1}

  included. Here, by contrast, the magnitude of natural internal variability is characterised by the spread of the model ensemble. {based on WGI Box 9.2, Figure 1}


  21               The connection between the heat budget and equilibrium climate sensitivity, which is the long-term surface warming under an assumed doubling of the atmospheric
                   CO2 concentration, arises because a warmer surface causes enhanced radiation to space which counteracts the increase in the Earth’s heat content. How much the
                   radiation to space increases for a given increase in surface temperature depends on the same feedback processes (e.g., cloud feedback, water vapour feedback) that
                   determine equilibrium climate sensitivity.

flaring, and forestry and other land use (FOLU), 1750–2011. Cumulative emissions and their uncertainties are shown as bars and whiskers, respectively, on the right-hand side. The
global effects of the accumulation of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are shown in Figure 1.3. Greenhouse gas emission data from 1970 to 2010 are shown in
Figure 1.6. {modified from WGI Figure TS.4 and WGIII Figure TS.2}


22    Forestry and other land use (FOLU)—also referred to as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry)—is the subset of agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU)
      emissions and removals of GHGs related to direct human-induced LULUCF activities, excluding agricultural emissions and removals (see WGIII AR5 Glossary).
23    Numbers from WGI 6.3 converted into GtCO2 units. Small differences in cumulative emissions from Working Group III {WGIII SPM.3, TS.2.1} are due to different approaches to
      rounding, different end years and the use of different data sets for emissions from FOLU. Estimates remain extremely close, given their uncertainties.
24    CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different GHGs. Throughout the SYR, when historical emissions of GHGs are provided in GtCO2-eq, they
      are weighted by Global Warming Potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100), taken from the IPCC Second Assessment Report unless otherwise stated. A unit abbreviation
      of GtCO2-eq is used. {Box 3.2, Glossary}

    Figure 1.6 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to 2010, by gases: CO2 from

    Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO2-equivalent emission weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and AR5 values.
    Unless otherwise stated, CO2-equivalent emissions in this report include the basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming
    Potential (GWP100) values from the SAR (see Glossary). Using the most recent GWP100 values from the AR5 (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions
    (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) from an increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend significantly. Other metric choices would change the contributions of different
    gases (see Box 3.2). The 2010 values are shown again broken down into their components with the associated uncertainties (90% confidence interval) indicated by the error bars.
    Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are known with an 8% uncertainty margin (90% confidence interval). There are very large uncertainties (of the order of ±50%)
    attached to the CO2 emissions from FOLU. Uncertainty about the global emissions of CH4, N2O and the F-gases has been estimated at 20%, 60% and 20%, respectively. 2010
    was the most recent year for which emission statistics on all gases as well as assessments of uncertainties were essentially complete at the time of data cut off for this report. The
    uncertainty estimates only account for uncertainty in emissions, not in the GWPs (as given in WGI 8.7). {WGIII Figure SPM.1}

Figure 1.10 | Comparison of observed and simulated change in continental surface temperatures on land (yellow panels), Arctic and Antarctic September sea ice extent (white
panels), and upper ocean heat content in the major ocean basins (blue panels). Global average changes are also given. Anomalies are given relative to 1880–1919 for surface
temperatures, to 1960–1980 for ocean heat content, and to 1979–1999 for sea ice. All time series are decadal averages, plotted at the centre of the decade. For temperature panels,
observations are dashed lines if the spatial coverage of areas being examined is below 50%. For ocean heat content and sea ice panels, the solid lines are where the coverage of
data is good and higher in quality, and the dashed lines are where the data coverage is only adequate, and, thus, uncertainty is larger (note that different lines indicate different
data sets; for details, see WGI Figure SPM.6). Model results shown are Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble ranges, with shaded bands
indicating the 5 to 95% confidence intervals. {WGI Figure SPM 6; for detail, see WGI Figure TS.12}

impacts attributed to climate change does not imply that such impacts have not occurred. The publications supporting attributed impacts reflect a growing knowledge base, but
publications are still limited for many regions, systems and processes, highlighting gaps in data and studies. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contri-
bution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact and confidence in attribution. Each symbol refers to one or more entries in WGII Table SPM.A1, grouping related
regional-scale impacts. Numbers in ovals indicate regional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010, based on the Scopus bibliographic database for publications
in English with individual countries mentioned in title, abstract or key words (as of July 2011). These numbers provide an overall measure of the available scientific literature on
climate change across regions; they do not indicate the number of publications supporting attribution of climate change impacts in each region. Studies for polar regions and small
islands are grouped with neighbouring continental regions. The inclusion of publications for assessment of attribution followed IPCC scientific evidence criteria defined in
WGII Chapter 18. Publications considered in the attribution analyses come from a broader range of literature assessed in the WGII AR5. See WGII Table SPM.A1 for descriptions
of the attributed impacts. (b) Average rates of change in distribution (km per decade) for marine taxonomic groups based on observations over 1900–2010. Positive distribution

long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are
strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments,
making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult.
However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation
and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on
a regional scale (medium confidence). Costs related to flood damage,
worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is
partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets. {WGI 2.6.2,

    Topic 2: Future Climate Changes, Risk and Impacts

          Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the
          climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limit-
          ing climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with
          adaptation, can limit climate change risks.


    Topic 2 assesses projections of future climate change and the resulting risks and impacts. Factors that determine future climate change, including
    scenarios for future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are outlined in Section 2.1. Descriptions of the methods and tools used to make projections
    of climate, impacts and risks, and their development since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), are provided in Boxes 2.1 to 2.3. Details of
    projected changes in the climate system, including the associated uncertainty and the degree of expert confidence in the projections are provided
    in Section 2.2. The future impacts of climate change on natural and human systems and associated risks are assessed in Section 2.3. Topic 2
    concludes with an assessment of irreversible changes, abrupt changes and changes beyond 2100 in Section 2.4.

          Box 2.1 | Advances, Confidence and Uncertainty in Modelling the Earth’s Climate System

          Improvements in climate models since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are evident in simulations of continental-
          scale surface temperature, large-scale precipitation, the monsoon, Arctic sea ice, ocean heat content, some extreme
          events, the carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, the effects of stratospheric ozone and the El Niño-Southern
          Oscillation. Climate models reproduce the observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and multi-decadal trends, includ-
          ing the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high
          confidence). The simulation of large-scale patterns of precipitation has improved somewhat since the AR4, although models continue
          to perform less well for precipitation than for surface temperature. Confidence in the representation of processes involving clouds and
          aerosols remains low. {WGI SPM D.1, 7.2.3, 7.3.3, 7.6.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.8, 10.3.1}

          The ability to simulate ocean thermal expansion, glaciers and ice sheets, and thus sea level, has improved since the AR4, but significant
          challenges remain in representing the dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This, together with advances in scientific
          understanding and capability, has resulted in improved sea level projections in this report, compared with the AR4. {WGI SPM E.6,
          9.1.3, 9.2, 9.4.2, 9.6, 9.8, 13.1, 13.4, 13.5}

          There is overall consistency between the projections from climate models in AR4 and AR5 for large-scale patterns of change and the
          magnitude of the uncertainty has not changed significantly, but new experiments and studies have led to a more complete and rigorous
          characterization of the uncertainty in long-term projections. {WGI 12.4}

    The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe four different 21st century pathways of greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs have been developed using
    Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) as input to a wide range of climate model simulations to project their consequences for the cli-
    mate system. These climate projections, in turn, are used for impacts and adaptation assessment. The RCPs are consistent with the wide
    range of scenarios in the mitigation literature assessed by WGIII2820. The scenarios are used to assess the costs associated with emission
    reductions consistent with particular concentration pathways. The RCPs represent the range of GHG emissions in the wider literature
    well (Box 2.2, Figure 1); they include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), and
    one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain emissions (‘baseline scenarios’)
    lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. RCP2.6 is representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely
    below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The majority of models indicate that scenarios meeting forcing levels similar to RCP2.6
    are characterized by substantial net negative emissions2921 by 2100, on average around 2 GtCO2/yr. The land use scenarios of RCPs,
    together, show a wide range of possible futures, ranging from a net reforestation to further deforestation, consistent with projections in
    the full scenario literature. For air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), the RCP scenarios assume a consistent decrease in emissions
    as a consequence of assumed air pollution control and GHG mitigation policy (Box 2.2, Figure 1). Importantly, these future scenarios
    do not account for possible changes in natural forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions) (see Box 1.1). {WGI Box SPM.1, 6.4, 8.5.3, 12.3,
    Annex II, WGII 19, 21, WGIII 6.3.2, 6.3.6}

    The RCPs cover a wider range than the scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) used in previous
    assessments, as they also represent scenarios with climate policy. In terms of overall forcing, RCP8.5 is broadly comparable to
    the SRES A2/A1FI scenario, RCP6.0 to B2 and RCP4.5 to B1. For RCP2.6, there is no equivalent scenario in SRES. As a result, the differ-
    ences in the magnitude of AR4 and AR5 climate projections are largely due to the inclusion of the wider range of emissions assessed.                                                           2

          subject of interest to reflect anticipated future conditions, while holding the other factors affecting the subject constant. ‘Analogies’
          make use of existing variations and are used when controlled experiments are impractical due to ethical constraints, the large area or
          long time required or high system complexity. Two types of analogies are used in projections of climate and impacts. Spatial analo-
          gies identify another part of the world currently experiencing similar conditions to those anticipated to be experienced in the future.
          Temporal analogies use changes in the past, sometimes inferred from paleo-ecological data, to make inferences about changes in the
          future. ‘Models’ are typically numerical simulations of real-world systems, calibrated and validated using observations from experi-
          ments or analogies, and then run using input data representing future climate. Models can also include largely descriptive narratives
          of possible futures, such as those used in scenario construction. Quantitative and descriptive models are often used together. Impacts
          are modelled, among other things, for water resources, biodiversity and ecosystem services on land, inland waters, the oceans and ice
          bodies, as well as for urban infrastructure, agricultural productivity, health, economic growth and poverty. {WGII 2.2.1, 2.4.2, 3.4.1,
          4.2.2, 5.4.1, 6.5, 7.3.1, 11.3.6, 13.2.2}

          Risks are evaluated based on the interaction of projected changes in the Earth system with the many dimensions of vul-
          nerability in societies and ecosystems. The data are seldom sufficient to allow direct estimation of probabilities of a given outcome;
          therefore, expert judgment using specific criteria (large magnitude, high probability or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts;
          persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation) is used
          to integrate the diverse information sources relating to the severity of consequences and the likelihood of occurrence into a risk evalu-
          ation, considering exposure and vulnerability in the context of specific hazards. {WGII 11.3, 19.2, 21.1, 21.3–21.5, 25.3–25.4, 25.11,

(shading). Grey lines and shading represent the CMIP5 historical simulations. Discontinuities at 2100 are due to different numbers of models performing the extension runs beyond
the 21st century and have no physical meaning. (b) Same as (a) but for the 2006–2100 period (relative to 1986–2005). (c) Change in Northern Hemisphere September sea-ice

Change in global mean sea level. (e) Change in ocean surface pH. For all panels, time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6
(blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The number of CMIP5 models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated. The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over the 2081–2100
period are given for all RCP scenarios as coloured vertical bars on the right hand side of panels (b) to (e). For sea-ice extent (c), the projected mean and uncertainty (minimum–
maximum range) is only given for the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and the 1979–2012 trend in the Arctic sea ice. For sea level (d),
based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could
cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. However, there is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not
exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. {WGI Figure SPM.7, Figure SPM.9, Figure 12.5, 6.4.4, 12.4.1, 13.4.4, 13.5.1}

    Notes:
    a
      Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble; changes calculated with respect to the 1986–2005 period. Using Hadley Centre Climatic
    Research Unit Gridded Surface Temperature Data Set 4 (HadCRUT4) and its uncertainty estimate (5 to 95% confidence interval), the observed warming from 1850–1900 to
    the reference period 1986–2005 is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C. Likely ranges have not been assessed here with respect to earlier reference periods because methods are not gen-
    erally available in the literature for combining the uncertainties in models and observations. Adding projected and observed changes does not account for potential effects
    of model biases compared to observations, and for natural internal variability during the observational reference period. {WGI 2.4.3, 11.2.2, 12.4.1, Table 12.2, Table 12.3}

      Based on 21 CMIP5 models; changes calculated with respect to the 1986–2005 period. Based on current understanding (from observations, physical understanding and
    modelling), only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range

    cCalculated from projections as 5 to 95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of
    confidence in models. For projections of global mean surface temperature change in 2046–2065, confidence is medium, because the relative importance of natural internal
    variability, and uncertainty in non-greenhouse gas forcing and response, are larger than for the 2081–2100 period. The likely ranges for 2046–2065 do not take into account
    the possible influence of factors that lead to the assessed range for near term (2016–2035) change in global mean surface temperature that is lower than the 5 to 95%
    model range, because the influence of these factors on longer term projections has not been quantified due to insufficient scientific understanding. {WGI 11.3.1}
    dCalculated from projections as 5 to 95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels
    of confidence in models. For projections of global mean sea level rise confidence is medium for both time horizons.

Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming
(accounting for both CO2 and other human influences on climate) to less
than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66%
would require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources
since 1870 to be limited to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for
non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario, with a range of 2550 to
3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate drivers across
the scenarios considered by WGIII (Table 2.2). About 1900 [1650 to

    a   Warming due to CO2 and non-CO2 drivers. Temperature values are given relative to the 1861–1880 base period.
    b Note that the 66% range in this table should not be equated to the likelihood statements in Table SPM.1 and Table 3.1 and WGIII Table SPM.1. The assessment in these
    latter tables is not only based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII using a single climate model, but also the assessment in WGI of the
    uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models.

     Cumulative CO2 emissions at the time the temperature threshold is exceeded that are required for 66%, 50% or 33% of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
    (CMIP5) complex models Earth System Model (ESM) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) simulations, assuming non-CO2 forcing follows the RCP8.5
    scenario. Similar cumulative emissions are implied by other RCP scenarios. For most scenario–threshold combinations, emissions and warming continue after the threshold
    is exceeded. Nevertheless, because of the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions, these figures provide an indication of the cumulative CO2 emissions implied by the CMIP5
    model simulations under RCP-like scenarios. Values are rounded to the nearest 50.
    dCumulative CO2 emissions at the time of peak warming from WGIII scenarios for which a fraction of greater than 66% (66 to 100%), greater than 50% (50 to 66%) or
    greater than 33% (33 to 50%) of climate simulations keep global mean temperature increase to below the stated threshold. Ranges indicate the variation in cumulative
    CO2 emissions arising from differences in non-CO2 drivers across the WGIII scenarios. The fraction of climate simulations for each scenario is derived from a 600-member
    parameter ensemble of a simple carbon-cycle climate model, Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), in a probabilistic mode.
    Parameter and scenario uncertainty are explored in this ensemble. Structural uncertainties cannot be explored with a single model set-up. Ranges show the impact of scenario
    uncertainty, with 80% of scenarios giving cumulative CO2 emissions within the stated range for the given fraction of simulations. Simple model estimates are constrained by
    observed changes over the past century, do not account for uncertainty in model structure and may omit some feedback processes: they are hence slightly higher than the
    CMIP5 complex models estimates. Values are rounded to the nearest 50.
    e The numerical results for the cumulative CO emissions for staying below 3°C with greater than 66% (66 to 100%) is greatly influenced by a large number of scenarios that
                                                 2
    would also meet the 2°C objective and therefore not comparable with numbers provided for the other temperature threshold.
    f Reserves are quantities able to be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions; resources are those where economic extraction is potentially feasible.

Figure 2.4 | Representative key risks for each region, including the potential for risk reduction through adaptation and mitigation, as well as limits to adaptation. Identification of
key risks was based on expert judgment using the following specific criteria: large magnitude, high probability or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability
or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation. Risk levels are assessed as very low, low, medium, high or very high for three
timeframes: the present, near term (here, for 2030–2040) and long term (here, for 2080–2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not
diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels are presented for two possible futures (2°C and 4°C global mean temperature increase above

     groups of terrestrial and freshwater species are unable to move fast enough to stay within the spatially shifting climate envelopes to which they are adapted. The median observed or modelled speeds at which species populations move (km/
     decade) are compared against the speed at which climate envelopes move across the landscape, given the projected climate change rates for each Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) over the 2050–2090 period. The results are
     presented for the average of all landscapes, globally, as well as for flat landscapes, where the climate envelope moves especially fast. (b) Sensitivity to ocean acidification is high in marine organisms building a calcium carbonate shell. The
     risks from OA increase with warming because OA lowers the tolerated levels of heat exposure, as seen in corals and crustaceans. (c) The height of a 50-year flood event has already increased in many coastal locations. A 10- to more than
     100-fold increase in the frequency of floods in many places would result from a 0.5 m rise in sea level in the absence of adaptation. Local adaptation capacity (and, in particular, protection) reaches its limits for ecosystems and human systems
     in many places under a 1 m sea level rise. (2.2.4, Table 2.1, Figure 2.8) {WGI 3.7.5, 3.8, 6.4.4, Figure 13.25, WGII Figure SPM.5, Figure 4-5, Figure 6-10, Box CC-OA, 4.4.2.5, 5.2, 5.3–5.5, 5.4.4, 5.5.6, 6.3}

    For 2100, RCP scenarios falling within each pCO2 category are as follows: RCP4.5 for 500 to 650 μatm, RCP6.0 for 651 to 850 μatm and RCP8.5 for 851 to 1370 μatm. By 2150,
    RCP8.5 falls within the 1371 to 2900 μatm category. The control category corresponds to 380 μatm (The unit μatm is approximately equivalent to ppm in the atmosphere). {WGI

Figure 2.7 | Summary of projected changes in crop yields (mostly wheat, maize, rice and soy) due to climate change over the 21st century. The figure combines 1090 data points
from crop model projections, covering different emission scenarios, tropical and temperate regions and adaptation and no-adaptation cases. The projections are sorted into the
20-year periods (horizontal axis) during which their midpoint occurs. Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels and data for each time period sum to 100%.
Relatively few studies have considered impacts on cropping systems for scenarios where global mean temperatures increase by 4°C or more. {WGII Figure SPM.7}

    Table 2.3 | Examples of global key risks for different sectors, including the potential for risk reduction through adaptation and mitigation, as well as limits to adaptation. Each
    key risk is assessed as very low, low, medium, high or very high. Risk levels are presented for three time frames: present, near term (here, for 2030–2040) and long term (here, for
    2080–2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels
    are presented for two possible futures (2°C and 4°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels). For each time frame, risk levels are indicated for a continuation
    of current adaptation and assuming high levels of current or future adaptation. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions. Relevant climate variables are
    indicated by icons. {WGII Table TS.4}

         text of Box 2.4 are relative to the 1986–2005 period. Adding ~0.6°C to these warming levels roughly gives warming relative to the
         1850–1900 period, used here as a proxy for pre-industrial times (right-hand scale in Box 2.4, Figure 1). {WGII Assessment Box SPM.1}

         The five RFCs are associated with:

         1.   Unique and threatened systems: Some ecosystems and cultures are already at risk from climate change (high confidence). With
              additional warming of around 1°C, the number of unique and threatened systems at risk of severe consequences increases. Many
              systems with limited adaptive capacity, particularly those associated with Arctic sea ice and coral reefs, are subject to very high
              risks with additional warming of 2°C. In addition to risks resulting from the magnitude of warming, terrestrial species are also
              sensitive to the rate of warming, marine species to the rate and degree of ocean acidification and coastal systems to sea level
              rise (Figure 2.5).

         2.   Extreme weather events: Climate change related risks from extreme events, such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and
              coastal flooding, are already moderate (high confidence). With 1°C additional warming, risks are high (medium confidence). Risks
              associated with some types of extreme events (e.g., extreme heat) increase progressively with further warming (high confidence).

         3.   Distribution of impacts: Risks are unevenly distributed between groups of people and between regions; risks are generally
2             greater for disadvantaged people and communities everywhere. Risks are already moderate because of regional differences in
              observed climate change impacts, particularly for crop production (medium to high confidence). Based on projected decreases in
              regional crop yields and water availability, risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high under additional warming of above 2°C
              (medium confidence).

         4.   Global aggregate impacts: Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate under additional warming of between 1°C and 2°C,
              reflecting impacts on both the Earth’s biodiversity and the overall global economy (medium confidence). Extensive biodiversity
              loss, with associated loss of ecosystem goods and services, leads to high risks at around 3°C additional warming (high confidence).
              Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but few quantitative
              estimates are available for additional warming of above 3°C.

         5.   Large-scale singular events: With increasing warming, some physical and ecological systems are at risk of abrupt and/or irre-
              versible changes (see Section 2.4). Risks associated with such tipping points are moderate between 0 and 1°C additional warming,
              since there are signs that both warm-water coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts
              (medium confidence). Risks increase at a steepening rate under an additional warming of 1 to 2°C and become high above 3°C,
              due to the potential for large and irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss. For sustained warming above some threshold
              greater than ~0.5°C additional warming (low confidence) but less than ~3.5°C (medium confidence), near-complete loss of the
              Greenland ice sheet would occur over a millennium or more, eventually contributing up to 7 m to global mean sea level rise.

                                                                                                                           (continued on next page)

    Topic 3: Future Pathways for Adaption, Mitigation and Sustainable Development

           Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Sub-
           stantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase
           prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to
           climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development.

    Adaptation and mitigation are two complementary strategies for responding to climate change. Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual
    or expected climate and its effects in order to either lessen or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Mitigation is the process of reducing
    emissions or enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs), so as to limit future climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation can reduce and
    manage the risks of climate change impacts. Yet adaptation and mitigation can also create other risks, as well as benefits. Strategic responses
    to climate change involve consideration of climate-related risks along with the risks and co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation actions. {WGII
    SPM A-3, SPM C, Glossary, WGIII SPM.2, 4.1, 5.1, Glossary}

    Mitigation, adaptation and climate impacts can all result in transformations to and changes in systems. Depending on the rate and magnitude
    of change and the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, climate change will alter ecosystems, food systems, infrastructure,
    coastal, urban and rural areas, human health and livelihoods. Adaptive responses to a changing climate require actions that range from incre-
    mental changes to more fundamental, transformational changes34.20Mitigation can involve fundamental changes in the way that human societies
    produce and use energy services and land. {WGII B, C, TS C, Box TS.8, Glossary, WGIII SPM.4}

    Topic 3 of this report examines the factors that influence the assessment of mitigation and adaptation strategies. It considers the benefits, risks,
    incremental changes and potential transformations from different combinations of mitigation, adaptation and residual climate-related impacts. It
    considers how responses in the coming decades will influence options for limiting long-term climate change and opportunities for adapting to it. Finally,
    it considers factors—including uncertainty, ethical considerations and links to other societal goals—that may influence choices about mitigation
    and adaptation. Topic 4 then assesses the prospects for mitigation and adaptation on the basis of current knowledge of tools, options and policies.

    emissions by 2050. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern (a) would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2 (b), which would constrain annual emissions over the next few
    decades (c). Panel a reproduces the five Reasons For Concern (Box 2.4). Panel b links temperature changes to cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2), from 1870. They are based
    on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations (pink plume) and on a simple climate model (median climate response in 2100) for the baselines and five
    mitigation scenario categories (six ellipses). Details are provided in Figure 2.3. Panel c shows the relationship between the cumulative CO2 emissions (in GtCO2) of the scenario
    categories and their associated change in annual GHG emissions by 2050, expressed in percentage change (in percent GtCO2-eq per year) relative to 2010. The ellipses correspond
    to the same scenario categories as in Panel b, and are built with a similar method (see details in Figure 2.3).

     Box 3.1 | The Limits of the Economic Assessment of Climate Change Risks

     A subset of climate change risks and impacts are often measured using aggregate economic indicators, such as gross
     domestic product (GDP) or aggregate income. Estimates, however, are partial and affected by important conceptual and
     empirical limitations. These incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for temperature increases of ~2.5°C above
     pre-industrial levels are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to
     be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement). Estimates of the incremental aggregate economic
     impact of emitting one more tonne of carbon dioxide (the social cost of carbon) are derived from these studies and lie between a few
     dollars and several hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon in 2000 to 2015 (robust evidence, medium agreement). These impact esti-
     mates are incomplete and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable. Many estimates do not account
     for the possibility of large-scale singular events and irreversibility, tipping points and other important factors, especially those that are
     difficult to monetize, such as loss of biodiversity. Estimates of aggregate costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors,
     regions, countries and communities, and they therefore depend on ethical considerations, especially on the aggregation of losses across
     and within countries (high confidence). Estimates of global aggregate economic losses exist only for limited warming levels. These
     levels are exceeded in scenarios for the 21st century unless additional mitigation action is implemented, leading to additional economic
     costs. The total economic effects at different temperature levels would include mitigation costs, co-benefits of mitigation, adverse side
     effects of mitigation, adaptation costs and climate damages. As a result, mitigation cost and climate damage estimates at any given
     temperature level cannot be compared to evaluate the costs and benefits of mitigation. Very little is known about the economic cost
     of warming above 3°C relative to the current temperature level. Accurately estimating climate change risks (and thus the benefits of
     mitigation) takes into account the full range of possible impacts of climate change, including those with high consequences but a low
     probability of occurrence. The benefits of mitigation may otherwise be underestimated (high confidence). Some limitations of current
     estimates may be unavoidable, even with more knowledge, such as issues with aggregating impacts over time and across individuals
     when values are heterogeneous. In view of these limitations, it is outside the scope of science to identify a single best climate change
     target and climate policy (3.1, 3.4). {WGII SPM B-2, 10.9.2, 10.9.4, 13.2, 17.2–17.3, 18.4, 19.6, WGIII 3.6}

36   For a discussion on CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and concentrations, see Box 3.2 on GHG metrics and mitigation pathways and the Glossary.
37   The range quoted here is based on the warming results of a simple climate model for the emissions of around 300 baseline scenarios, expressed compared to the 1850–1900
     period. The warming results quoted in Section 2.2 are obtained by prescribing future concentrations of GHG in CMIP5 Earth System Models. This results in a mean warming of
     1.0°C (5th to 95th percentile range: 0.3°C to 1.7°C) for RCP2.6, and a mean warming of 3.7°C (2.6°C to 4.8°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986–2005. For the same
     concentration-driven experiments, the simple climate model approach gives consistent results. The median warming is 0.9°C (0.5°C to 1.6°C) for RCP2.6 and 3.7°C (2.5°C
     to 5.9°C) for RCP8.5 relative to the period 1986–2005. However, the high-end of the CMIP5 ESMs range is more constrained. In addition, the baseline temperature increase
     quoted here is wider than that of the concentration-driven RCP8.5 experiments mentioned above as it is based on a wider set of scenarios, includes carbon cycle response
     uncertainty, and uses a different base year (2.2, 3.4).
38   In concentration ‘overshoot’ scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline.

     CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions
     could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale.

Notes:
a The ‘total range’ for the 430 to 480 ppm CO -eq concentrations scenarios corresponds to the range of the 10th to 90th percentile of the subcategory of these scenarios shown in
                                             2
Table 6.3 of the Working Group III report.
b Baseline scenarios fall into the >1000 and 720 to 1000 ppm CO2-eq categories. The latter category also includes mitigation scenarios. The baseline scenarios in the latter category
reach a temperature change of 2.5°C to 5.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 in 2100. Together with the baseline scenarios in the >1000 ppm CO2-eq category, this leads
to an overall 2100 temperature range of 2.5°C to 7.8°C (range based on median climate response: 3.7°C to 4.8°C) for baseline scenarios across both concentration categories.
c
  The global 2010 emissions are 31% above the 1990 emissions (consistent with the historic greenhouse gas emission estimates presented in this report). CO2-eq emissions include
the basket of Kyoto gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as fluorinated gases).                                                                           3
dThe assessment here involves a large number of scenarios published in the scientific literature and is thus not limited to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). To
evaluate the CO2-eq concentration and climate implications of these scenarios, the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) was used in a
probabilistic mode. For a comparison between MAGICC model results and the outcomes of the models used in WGI, see WGI 12.4.1.2, 12.4.8 and WGIII 6.3.2.6.
e
 The assessment in this table is based on the probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII using MAGICC and the assessment in WGI of the uncertainty of the
temperature projections not covered by climate models. The statements are therefore consistent with the statements in WGI, which are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) runs of the RCPs and the assessed uncertainties. Hence, the likelihood statements reflect different lines of evidence from both WGs. This WGI method was
also applied for scenarios with intermediate concentration levels where no CMIP5 runs are available. The likelihood statements are indicative only {WGIII 6.3} and follow broadly
the terms used by the WGI SPM for temperature projections: likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, and unlikely 0–33%. In addition
the term more unlikely than likely 0–<50% is used.
fThe CO2-equivalent concentration (see Glossary) is calculated on the basis of the total forcing from a simple carbon cycle/climate model, MAGICC. The CO2-equivalent concentra-
tion in 2011 is estimated to be 430 ppm (uncertainty range 340 to 520 ppm). This is based on the assessment of total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 in
WGI, i.e., 2.3 W/m2, uncertainty range 1.1 to 3.3 W/m2.
g
    The vast majority of scenarios in this category overshoot the category boundary of 480 ppm CO2-eq concentration.
hFor scenarios in this category, no CMIP5 run or MAGICC realization stays below the respective temperature level. Still, an unlikely assignment is given to reflect uncertainties that
may not be reflected by the current climate models.
i
 Scenarios in the 580 to 650 ppm CO2-eq category include both overshoot scenarios and scenarios that do not exceed the concentration level at the high end of the category
(e.g., RCP4.5). The latter type of scenarios, in general, have an assessed probability of more unlikely than likely to stay below the 2°C temperature level, while the former are mostly
assessed to have an unlikely probability of staying below this level.
j   In these scenarios, global CO2-eq emissions in 2050 are between 70 to 95% below 2010 emissions, and they are between 110 to 120% below 2010 emissions in 2100.

    in mitigation scenarios that are at least about as likely as not to keep warming throughout the 21st century below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 CO2-eq concentrations
    430 to 530 ppm). The scenarios are grouped according to different emissions levels by 2030 (coloured in different shades of green). The left panel shows the pathways of GHG
    emissions (GtCO2-eq/yr) leading to these 2030 levels. Black dot with whiskers gives historic GHG emission levels and associated uncertainties in 2010 as reported in Figure 1.6.
3   The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Cancún Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average annual CO2 emission reduction rates
    for the 2030–2050 period. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent intermodel comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of
    scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emission changes (sustained over a period of 20 years) are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel
    show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from between 2030 and 2050, subject to different 2030 GHG emission levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy
    supply includes renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Only scenarios that apply
    the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions
    (>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions, and scenarios with 2010 emission levels that are significantly outside the historical range are excluded.

Figure 3.4 | Global mitigation costs in cost-effective scenarios at different atmospheric concentrations levels in 2100 (right panel) and growth in economic consumption in the
corresponding baseline scenarios (those without additional mitigation) (left panel). The table at the top shows percentage points of annualized consumption growth reductions
relative to consumption growth in the baseline of 1.6 to 3% per year (e.g., if the reduction is 0.06 percentage points per year due to mitigation, and baseline growth is 2.0% per
year, then the growth rate with mitigation would be 1.94% per year). Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and
they impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’ default technology assumptions. Consumption losses are shown relative to a baseline development
without climate policy. Cost estimates shown in this table do not consider the benefits of reduced climate change nor co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation. Estimates
at the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inflexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions that would be required in the long run to meet these
goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise costs. {WGIII Table SPM.2, Figure TS.12, 6.3.6, Figure 6.21}

    Notes:
    a
     Delayed mitigation scenarios are associated with greenhouse gas emission of more than 55 GtCO2-eq in 2030, and the increase in mitigation costs is measured relative to cost-
    effective mitigation scenarios for the same long-term concentration level.
    b Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models’

    default technology assumptions.
    c
     The range is determined by the central scenarios encompassing the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenario set. Only scenarios with a time horizon until 2100 are included.
    Some models that are included in the cost ranges for concentration levels above 530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 could not produce associated scenarios for concentration levels below
    530 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 with assumptions about limited availability of technologies and/or delayed additional mitigation.
    d No CCS: carbon dioxide capture and storage is not included in these scenarios. Nuclear phase out: no addition of nuclear power plants beyond those under construction, and

    operation of existing plants until the end of their lifetime. Limited Solar/Wind: a maximum of 20% global electricity generation from solar and wind power in any year of these
    scenarios. Limited Bioenergy: a maximum of 100 EJ/yr modern bioenergy supply globally (modern bioenergy used for heat, power, combinations and industry was around 18 EJ/yr
    in 2008). EJ = Exajoule = 1018 Joule.
    e Percentage increase of net present value of consumption losses in percent of baseline consumption (for scenarios from general equilibrium models) and abatement costs in percent

    of baseline gross domestic product (GDP, for scenarios from partial equilibrium models) for the period 2015–2100, discounted at 5% per year.

    Box 3.2 | Greenhouse Gas Metrics and Mitigation Pathways




                                                                                                                                                                                 Introduction
    This box focuses on emission-based metrics that are used for calculating CO2-equivalent emissions for the formulation and evaluation
    of mitigation strategies. These emission metrics are distinct from the concentration-based metric used in SYR (CO2-equivalent concen-
    tration). For an explanation of CO2-equivalent emissions and CO2-equivalent concentrations, see Glossary.

    Emission metrics facilitate multi-component climate policies by allowing emissions of different greenhouse gases (GHGs)
    and other climate forcing agents to be expressed in a common unit (so-called ‘CO2-equivalent emissions’). The Global
    Warming Potential (GWP) was introduced in the IPCC First Assessment Report, where it was also used to illustrate the difficulties in
    comparing components with differing physical properties using a single metric. The 100-year GWP (GWP100) was adopted by the United
    Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol and is now used widely as the default metric. It
    is only one of several possible emission metrics and time horizons. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9}

    The choice of emission metric and time horizon depends on type of application and policy context; hence, no single metric
    is optimal for all policy goals. All metrics have shortcomings, and choices contain value judgments, such as the climate effect con-
    sidered and the weighting of effects over time (which explicitly or implicitly discounts impacts over time), the climate policy goal and
    the degree to which metrics incorporate economic or only physical considerations. There are significant uncertainties related to metrics,
    and the magnitudes of the uncertainties differ across metric type and time horizon. In general, the uncertainty increases for metrics
    along the cause–effect chain from emission to effects. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9}

    The weight assigned to non-CO2 climate forcing agents relative to CO2 depends strongly on the choice of metric and time
    horizon (robust evidence, high agreement). GWP compares components based on radiative forcing, integrated up to a chosen time
    horizon. Global Temperature change Potential (GTP; see Glossary) is based on the temperature response at a specific point in time with
    no weight on temperature response before or after the chosen point in time. Adoption of a fixed horizon of, for example, 20, 100 or
    500 years for these metrics will inevitably put no weight on climate outcomes beyond the time horizon, which is significant for CO2
    as well as other long-lived gases. The choice of time horizon markedly affects the weighting especially of short-lived climate forcing
    agents, such as methane (CH4) (see Box 3.2, Table 1; Box 3.2, Figure 1a). For some metrics (e.g., the dynamic GTP; see Glossary), the
    weighting changes over time as a chosen target year is approached. {WGI 8.7, WGIII 3.9}

    Notes:
    a
      Global Warming Potential (GWP) values have been updated in successive IPCC reports; the AR5 GWP100 values are different from those adopted for the Kyoto Protocol’s
    First Commitment Period which are from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). Note that for consistency, equivalent CO2 emissions given elsewhere in this Synthesis
    Report are also based on SAR, not AR5 values. For a comparison of emissions using SAR and AR5 GWP100 values for 2010 emissions, see Figure 1.6.
    b   No single lifetime can be given for CO2. {WGI Box 6.1, 6.1.1, 8.7}



    The choice of emission metric affects the timing and emphasis placed on abating short- and long-lived climate forcing
    agents. For most metrics, global cost differences are small under scenarios of global participation and cost-minimizing
    mitigation pathways, but implications for some individual countries and sectors could be more significant (medium evi-
    dence, high agreement). Different metrics and time horizons significantly affect the contributions from various sources/sectors and
    components, particularly short-lived climate forcing agents (Box 3.2, Figure 1b). A fixed time independent metric that gives less weight
    to short-lived agents such as CH4 (e.g., using GTP100 instead of GWP100) would require earlier and more stringent CO2 abatement to
    achieve the same climate outcome for 2100. Using a time-dependent metric, such as a dynamic GTP, leads to less CH4 mitigation

         in the near term but to more in the long term as the target date is being approached. This implies that for some (short-lived) agents,
         the metric choice influences the choice of policies and the timing of mitigation (especially for sectors and countries with high non-CO2
         emission levels). {WGI 8.7, WGIII 6.3}

    Possible Roles, Options, Risks and Status

    Geoengineering refers to a broad set of methods and technologies operating on a large scale that aim to deliberately alter the climate
    system in order to alleviate the impacts of climate change. Most methods seek to either reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy
    in the climate system (Solar Radiation Management, SRM) or increase the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by
    sinks to alter climate (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR, see Glossary). Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive assessment of feasi-
    bility, cost, side effects and environmental impacts of either CDR or SRM. {WGI SPM E.8, 6.5, 7.7, WGII 6.4, Table 6-5, Box 20-4, WGIII
    TS.3.1.3, 6.9}

    CDR plays a major role in many mitigation scenarios. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforesta-
    tion are the only CDR methods included in these scenarios. CDR technologies are particularly important in scenarios that temporarily
    overshoot atmospheric concentrations, but they are also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual
    emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive. Similar to mitigation, CDR would need to be deployed on a large scale
    and over a long time period to be able to significantly reduce CO2 concentrations (see Section 3.1). {WGII 6.4, WGIII SPM 4.1, TS.3.1.2,
    TS 3.1.3, 6.3, 6.9}

    Several CDR techniques could potentially reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) levels. However, there are biogeo-
    chemical, technical and societal limitations that, to varying degrees, make it difficult to provide quantitative estimates
    of the potential for CDR. The emission mitigation from CDR is less than the removed CO2, as some CO2 is released from that previ-
    ously stored in oceans and terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Sub-sea geologic storage has been implemented on a regional scale, with no
    evidence to date of ocean impact from leakage. The climatic and environmental side effects of CDR depend on technology and scale.
    Examples are associated with altered surface reflectance from afforestation and ocean de-oxygenation from ocean fertilization. Most
    terrestrial CDR techniques would involve competing demands for land and could involve local and regional risks, while maritime CDR
    techniques may involve significant risks for ocean ecosystems, so that their deployment could pose additional challenges for coopera-
    tion between countries. {WGI 6.5, FAQ 7.3, WGII 6.4, Table 6.5, WGIII 6.9}

    SRM is untested, and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios, but, if realisable, could to some degree offset
    global temperature rise and some of its effects. It could possibly provide rapid cooling in comparison to CO2 mitigation.
    There is medium confidence that SRM through stratospheric aerosol injection is scalable to counter radiative forcing from a twofold
    increase in CO2 concentrations and some of the climate responses associated with warming. Due to insufficient understanding there is               3
    no consensus on whether a similarly large negative counter radiative forcing could be achieved from cloud brightening. Land albedo
    change does not appear to be able to produce a large counter radiative forcing. Even if SRM could counter the global mean warming,
    differences in spatial patterns would remain. The scarcity of literature on other SRM techniques precludes their assessment. {WGI 7.7,
    WGIII TS.3.1.3, 6.9}

    If it were deployed, SRM would entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings. Several lines of evidence
    indicate that SRM would itself produce a small but significant decrease in global precipitation (with larger differences on regional
    scales). Stratospheric aerosol SRM is likely to modestly increase ozone losses in the polar stratosphere. SRM would not prevent the CO2
    effects on ecosystems and ocean acidification that are unrelated to warming. There could also be other unanticipated consequences.
    For all future scenarios considered in AR5, SRM would need to increase commensurately, to counter the global mean warming, which
    would exacerbate side effects. Additionally, if SRM were increased to substantial levels and then terminated, there is high confidence
    that surface temperatures would rise very rapidly (within a decade or two). This would stress systems that are sensitive to the rate of
    warming. {WGI 7.6–7.7, FAQ 7.3, WGII 19.5, WGIII 6.9}

    SRM technologies raise questions about costs, risks, governance and ethical implications of development and deploy-
    ment. There are special challenges emerging for international institutions and mechanisms that could coordinate research
    and possibly restrain testing and deployment. Even if SRM would reduce human-made global temperature increase, it would
    imply spatial and temporal redistributions of risks. SRM thus introduces important questions of intragenerational and intergenerational
    justice. Research on SRM, as well as its eventual deployment, has been subject to ethical objections. In spite of the estimated low
    potential costs of some SRM deployment technologies, they will not necessarily pass a benefit–cost test that takes account of the range
    of risks and side effects. The governance implications of SRM are particularly challenging, especially as unilateral action might lead to
    significant effects and costs for others. {WGIII TS.3.1.3, 1.4, 3.3, 6.9, 13.4}

    A government policy or a measure intended to achieve one objective often affects other objectives, either positively or
    negatively. For example, mitigation policies can influence local air quality (see Figure 3.5). When the effects are positive they are
    called ‘co-benefits’, also referred to as ‘ancillary benefits’. Negative effects are referred to as ‘adverse side effects’. Some measures
    are labelled ‘no or low regret’ when their co-benefits are sufficient to justify their implementation, even in the absence of immediate
    direct benefits. Co-benefits and adverse side effects can be measured in monetary or non-monetary units. The effect of co-benefits and
    adverse side effects from climate policies on overall social welfare has not yet been quantitatively examined, with the exception of a
    few recent multi-objective studies. Many of these have not been well quantified, and effects can be case and site-specific as they will
    depend on local circumstances. {WGII 11.9, 16.3.1, 17.2, 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 3.6, 5.7}

    Co-benefits of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives, such as those related to energy security, air qual-
    ity, efforts to address ecosystem impacts, income distribution, labour supply and employment and urban sprawl (see
    Table 4.2 and Table 4.5). In the absence of complementary policies, however, some mitigation measures may have adverse side
    effects (at least in the short term), for example on biodiversity, food security, energy access, economic growth and income distribu-
    tion. The co-benefits of adaptation policies may include improved access to infrastructure and services, extended education and health
    systems, reduced disaster losses, better governance and others. {WGII 4.4.4, 11.9, 15.2, 17.2, 20.3.3, 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 6.6}

    Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development take into
    account the co-benefits, adverse side effects and risks that may arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. The
    assessment of overall social welfare impacts is complicated by this interaction between climate change response options and pre-
    existing non-climate policies. For example, in terms of air quality, the value of the extra tonne of sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduction that
    occurs with climate change mitigation through reduced fossil fuel combustion depends greatly on the stringency of SO2 control policies.
    If SO2 policy is weak, the value of SO2 reductions may be large, but if SO2 policy is stringent, it may be near zero. Similarly, in terms of
    adaptation and disaster risk management, weak policies can lead to an adaptation deficit that increases human and economic losses
    from natural climate variability. ‘Adaptation deficit’ refers to the lack of capacity to manage adverse impacts of current climate vari-
    ability. An existing adaptation deficit increases the benefits of adaptation policies that improve the management of climate variability
    and change. {WGII 20.4.1, WGIII Box TS.11, 6.3}

    Topic 4: Adaptation and Mitigation

          Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single option is sufficient by itself.
          Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at all scales and can be enhanced through integrated
          responses that link mitigation and adaptation with other societal objectives.


    Topic 3 demonstrates the need and strategic considerations for both adaptation and global-scale mitigation to manage risks from climate change.
    Building on these insights, Topic 4 presents near-term response options that could help achieve such strategic goals. Near-term adaptation and
    mitigation actions will differ across sectors and regions, reflecting development status, response capacities and near- and long-term aspirations
    with regard to both climate and non-climate outcomes. Because adaptation and mitigation inevitably take place in the context of multiple
    objectives, particular attention is given to the ability to develop and implement integrated approaches that can build on co-benefits and manage
    trade-offs.


    4.1       Common enabling factors and constraints                          lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption,

Figure 4.1 | Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by sector and total non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Kyoto gases) across sectors in baseline (left panel) and mitigation
scenarios that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO2-eq (likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS, middle panel)
and without CCS (right panel). Light yellow background denotes direct CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions for both the baseline and mitigation scenarios. In addition, for the baseline
scenarios, the sum of direct and indirect emissions from the energy end-use sectors (transport, buildings and industry) is also shown (dark yellow background). Mitigation scenarios
show direct emissions only. However, mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the end-
use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. Note that for calculating the indirect emissions
only electricity emissions are allocated from energy supply to end-use sectors. The numbers at the bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range,
which differs across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Note that many models cannot reach concentrations of about 450 ppm CO2-eq
by 2100 in the absence of CCS, resulting in a low number of scenarios for the right panel. Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with
carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). ‘Net’ agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities.

    centrations by 2100 (at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels). Blue bars for ‘low energy demand’ show the deployment range of scenarios
    with limited growth in final energy demand of <20% in 2050 compared to 2010. Red bars show the deployment range of technologies in a case of ‘high energy demand’ (>20%
    growth in 2050 compared to 2010). For each technology, the median, interquartile and full deployment range is displayed. Notes: Scenarios assuming technology restrictions are
    excluded. Ranges include results from many different integrated models. Multiple scenario results from the same model were averaged to avoid sampling biases. {WGIII Figure TS.16}

    Effective integrated responses depend on suitable tools and gov-
    ernance structures, as well as adequate capacity (medium confi-
    dence). Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires
    tools to help understand interactions and support decision-making
    at local and regional scales. Integrated responses also depend on
    governance that enables coordination across scales and sectors, sup-
    ported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing
    suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading
    the human and institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated
    responses. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 2.2, 2.4, 15.4, 15.5, 16.3, Table 14-1,

    As defined in the IPCC Procedures, the Synthesis Report (SYR) synthesises and integrates material contained within IPCC Assessment Reports and
    Special Reports. The scope of the SYR of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) includes material contained in the three Working Group contributions
    to the AR5, and it draws on information contained in other IPCC Reports as required. The SYR is based exclusively on assessments by the IPCC
    Working Groups; it does not refer to or assess the primary scientific literature itself.
I
    The SYR is a self-contained, condensed summary of the much richer information contained in the underlying Working Group Reports. Users may
    wish to access relevant material at the required level of detail in the following manner: the report contains a Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
    that provides the most condensed summary of the current understanding of scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of climate change.
    All references in curly brackets in this SPM refer to sections in the longer report. The longer report consists of an Introduction and four Topics. The
    numbers of the SPM sections largely correspond with the section numbers of the Topics. At the end of each paragraph, references are provided in
    italics between curly brackets. These refer to the Summaries for Policymakers (SPMs), Technical Summaries (TSs), Executive Summaries of chapters
    (ESs) and chapters (with chapter and section numbers) of the underlying Working Group contributions to the AR5 and Special Reports of the AR5.
    References to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in 2007 are identified by adding “AR4” to the reference.

    Users who wish to gain a better understanding of scientific details or access the primary scientific literature on which the SYR is based should
    refer to chapter sections of the underlying Working Group reports that are cited in the longer report of the SYR. The individual chapters of the
    Working Group reports provide references to the primary scientific literature on which IPCC assessments are based, and also offer the most
    detailed region- and sector-specific information.

    A glossary, a list of acronyms, lists of authors and reviewers, a list of IPCC publications (annexes) and an index are provided to further facilitate
    the use of this report.
