Climate Change 2001:
Synthesis Report
Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report forms the fourth volume of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third
Assessment Report, and is composed of the Synthesis Report itself, the Summaries for Policymakers and Technical
Summaries of the three IPCC Working Group volumes, and supporting annexes.

IPCC assessments attempt to answer such general questions as:
  • Has the Earth’s climate changed as a result of human activities?
  • In what ways is climate projected to change in the future?
  • How vulnerable are agriculture, water supply, ecosystems, coastal infrastructure, and human health to different levels of
    change in climate and sea level?
  • What is the technical, economic, and market potential of options to adapt to climate change or reduce emissions of the
    gases that influence climate?

Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report provides a policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive, synthesis and integration of
information contained within the Third Assessment Report and also draws upon all previously approved and accepted IPCC
reports that address a broad range of key policy-relevant questions. For this reason it will be especially useful for
policymakers and researchers, and as a main or supplementary student textbook for courses in environmental studies,
meteorology, climatology, biology, ecology, and atmospheric chemistry.

    Introduction

    In accordance with a decision taken at its Thirteenth Session (Maldives, 22 and 25-28 September
    1997) and other subsequent decisions, the IPCC decided:

     • To include a Synthesis Report as part of its Third Assessment Report
     • That the Synthesis Report would provide a policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive, synthesis
       and integration of information contained within the Third Assessment Report and also drawing
       upon all previously approved and accepted IPCC reports that would address a broad range of
       key policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive, questions
     • That the questions would be developed in consultation with the Conference of the Parties
       (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

    The following nine questions were based on submissions by governments and were approved by
    the IPCC at its Fifteenth Session (San José, Costa Rica, 15-18 April 1999).




                                                                                                                              Q1
    Question 1

    What can scientific, technical, and socio-economic analyses contribute to
    the determination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic
    interference with the climate system as referred to in Article 2 of the
    Framework Convention on Climate Change?


    Natural, technical, and social sciences can provide essential                                                    Q1.1
    information and evidence needed for decisions on what constitutes
    “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” At
    the same time, such decisions are value judgments determined
    through socio-political processes, taking into account considerations
    such as development, equity, and sustainability, as well as
    uncertainties and risk.

    The basis for determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference”                                Q1.2
    will vary among regions—depending both on the local nature and consequences
    of climate change impacts, and also on the adaptive capacity available to cope
    with climate change—and depends upon mitigative capacity, since the magnitude
    and the rate of change are both important. There is no universally applicable best set of
    policies; rather, it is important to consider both the robustness of different policy measures against
    a range of possible future worlds, and the degree to which such climate-specific policies can be
    integrated with broader sustainable development policies.

    The Third Assessment Report (TAR) provides an assessment of new scientific                                       Q1.3-6
    information and evidence as an input for policymakers in their determination of
    what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”
    It provides, first, new projections of future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the
    atmosphere, global and regional patterns of changes and rates of change in temperature,
    precipitation, and sea level, and changes in extreme climate events. It also examines possibilities
    for abrupt and irreversible changes in ocean circulation and the major ice sheets. Second, it provides
    an assessment of the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change, with regard to
    risks to unique and threatened systems, risks associated with extreme weather events, the distribution
    of impacts, aggregate impacts, and risks of large-scale, high-impact events. Third, it provides an
    assessment of the potential for achieving a broad range of levels of greenhouse gas
    concentrations in the atmosphere through mitigation, and information about how adaptation can
    reduce vulnerability.

An integrated view of climate change considers the dynamics of the complete cycle                                 Q1.7
of interlinked causes and effects across all sectors concerned (see Figure SPM-1).
The TAR provides new policy-relevant information and evidence with regard to all quadrants of
Figure SPM-1. A major new contribution of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)
was to explore alternative development paths and related greenhouse gas emissions, and the TAR
assessed preliminary work on the linkage between adaptation, mitigation, and development paths.
However, the TAR does not achieve a fully integrated assessment of climate change because of
the incomplete state of knowledge.

Climate change decision making is essentially a sequential process under general                                  Q1.8
uncertainty. Decision making has to deal with uncertainties including the risk of non-linear and/
or irreversible changes, entails balancing the risks of either insufficient or excessive action, and
involves careful consideration of the consequences (both environmental and economic), their
likelihood, and society’s attitude towards risk.

    The climate change issue is part of the larger challenge of sustainable development.                             Q1.9-10
    As a result, climate policies can be more effective when consistently embedded
    within broader strategies designed to make national and regional development
    paths more sustainable. This occurs because the impact of climate variability and change,
    climate policy responses, and associated socio-economic development will affect the ability of
    countries to achieve sustainable development goals. Conversely, the pursuit of those goals will in
    turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate policies. In particular, the socio-economic
    and technological characteristics of different development paths will strongly affect emissions,
    the rate and magnitude of climate change, climate change impacts, the capability to adapt, and the
    capacity to mitigate.

    The TAR assesses available information on the timing, opportunities, costs, benefits,                            Q1.11
    and impacts of various mitigation and adaptation options. It indicates that there are
    opportunities for countries acting individually, and in cooperation with others, to reduce costs of
    mitigation and adaptation and to realize benefits associated with achieving sustainable development.

    Question 2

    What is the evidence for, causes of, and consequences of changes in the
    Earth’s climate since the pre-industrial era?

    (a)    Has the Earth’s climate changed since the pre-industrial era at the
           regional and/or global scale? If so, what part, if any, of the observed
           changes can be attributed to human influence and what part, if any,
           can be attributed to natural phenomena? What is the basis for that
           attribution?
    (b)    What is known about the environmental, social, and economic
           consequences of climate changes since the pre-industrial era with
           an emphasis on the last 50 years?


    The Earth’s climate system has demonstrably changed on both global                                               Q2.2
    and regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some of these
    changes attributable to human activities.

    Human activities have increased the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse                                     Q2.4-5
    gases and aerosols since the pre-industrial era. The atmospheric concentrations of key
    anthropogenic greenhouse gases (i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
    and tropospheric ozone (O3)) reached their highest recorded levels in the 1990s, primarily due to
    the combustion of fossil fuels, agriculture, and land-use changes (see Table SPM-1). The radiative
    forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is positive with a small uncertainty range; that from
    the direct aerosol effects is negative and smaller; whereas the negative forcing from the indirect
    effects of aerosols on clouds might be large but is not well quantified.

    An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming world                                 Q2.6
    and other changes in the climate system (see Table SPM-1).

    Globally it is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade, and 1998 the                                   Q2.7
    warmest year, in the instrumental record (1861–2000) (see Box SPM-1). The increase
    in surface temperature over the 20th century for the Northern Hemisphere is likely to have been
    greater than that for any other century in the last thousand years (see Table SPM-1). Insufficient
    data are available prior to the year 1860 in the Southern Hemisphere to compare the recent warming
    with changes over the last 1,000 years. Temperature changes have not been uniform globally but
    have varied over regions and different parts of the lower atmosphere.

 Weather indicators

 Global mean surface temperature              Increased by 0.6±0.2°C over the 20th century; land areas warmed more than the oceans

 temperature                                  years; 1990s warmest decade of the millennium (likely).
 Diurnal surface temperature range            Decreased over the years 1950 to 2000 over land: nighttime minimum temperatures
                                              increased at twice the rate of daytime maximum temperatures (likely).
 Hot days / heat index                        Increased (likely).

 Continental precipitation                    Increased by 5–10% over the 20th century in the Northern Hemisphere (very likely),
                                              although decreased in some regions (e.g., north and west Africa and parts of the

 Heavy precipitation events                   Increased at mid- and high northern latitudes (likely).
 Frequency and severity of drought            Increased summer drying and associated incidence of drought in a few areas (likely). In

                                              have been observed to increase in recent decades.

 Where appropriate, the authors of the Third Assessment Report assigned confidence levels that represent
 their collective judgment in the validity of a conclusion based on observational evidence, modeling
 results, and theory that they have examined. The following words have been used throughout the text of
 the Synthesis Report to the TAR relating to WGI findings: virtually certain (greater than 99% chance
 that a result is true); very likely (90–99% chance); likely (66–90% chance); medium likelihood (33–66%
 chance); unlikely (10–33% chance); very unlikely (1–10% chance); and exceptionally unlikely (less
 than 1% chance). An explicit uncertainty range (±) is a likely range. Estimates of confidence relating to
 WGII findings are: very high (95% or greater), high (67–95%), medium (33–67%), low (5–33%), and
 very low (5% or less). No confidence levels were assigned in WGIII.



There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the                                          Q2.9-11
last 50 years is attributable to human activities. Detection and attribution studies
consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the last 35 to 50
years. These studies include uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and
natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance), but do not account for the effects of other types of
anthropogenic aerosols and land-use changes. The sulfate and natural forcings are negative over
this period and cannot explain the warming; whereas most of these studies find that, over the last
50 years, the estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing greenhouse gases alone

     Indicator                                     Observed Changes
     Biological and physical indicators
     Global mean sea level                         Increased at an average annual rate of 1 to 2 mm during the 20th century.
     Duration of ice cover of rivers and lakes     Decreased by about 2 weeks over the 20th century in mid- and high latitudes of the
                                                   Northern Hemisphere (very likely).
     Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness           Thinned by 40% in recent decades in late summer to early autumn (likely) and decreased
                                                   in extent by 10–15% since the 1950s in spring and summer.
     Non-polar glaciers                            Widespread retreat during the 20th century.
     Snow cover                                    Decreased in area by 10% since global observations became available from satellites in
                                                   the 1960s (very likely).
     Permafrost                                    Thawed, warmed, and degraded in parts of the polar, sub-polar, and mountainous regions.
     El Niño events                                Became more frequent, persistent, and intense during the last 20 to 30 years compared to
                                                   the previous 100 years.
     Growing season                                Lengthened by about 1 to 4 days per decade during the last 40 years in the Northern
                                                   Hemisphere, especially at higher latitudes.
     Plant and animal ranges                       Shifted poleward and up in elevation for plants, insects, birds, and fish.
     Breeding, flowering, and migration            Earlier plant flowering, earlier bird arrival, earlier dates of breeding season, and earlier
                                                   emergence of insects in the Northern Hemisphere.
     Coral reef bleaching                          Increased frequency, especially during El Niño events.
     Economic indicators
     Weather-related economic losses               Global inflation-adjusted losses rose an order of magnitude over the last 40 years (see Q2
                                                   Figure 2-7). Part of the observed upward trend is linked to socio-economic factors and
                                                   part is linked to climatic factors.
     a   This table provides examples of key observed changes and is not an exhaustive list. It includes both changes attributable to
         anthropogenic climate change and those that may be caused by natural variations or anthropogenic climate change. Confidence
         levels are reported where they are explicitly assessed by the relevant Working Group. An identical table in the Synthesis Report
         contains cross-references to the WGI and WGII reports.


    are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming. The best agreement between model
    simulations and observations over the last 140 years has been found when all the above
    anthropogenic and natural forcing factors are combined, as shown in Figure SPM-2.

    Changes in sea level, snow cover, ice extent, and precipitation are consistent with                                     Q2.12-19
    a warming climate near the Earth’s surface. Examples of these include a more active
    hydrological cycle with more heavy precipitation events and shifts in precipitation, widespread
    retreat of non-polar glaciers, increases in sea level and ocean-heat content, and decreases in snow
    cover and sea-ice extent and thickness (see Table SPM-1). For instance, it is very likely that the
    20th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed sea-level rise, through thermal
    expansion of seawater and widespread loss of land ice. Within present uncertainties, observations
    and models are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea-level rise during the
    20th century. There are no demonstrated changes in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent from the years
    1978 to 2000. In addition, there are conflicting analyses and insufficient data to assess changes in
    intensities of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones and severe local storm activity in the mid-latitudes.
    Some of the observed changes are regional and some may be due to internal climate variations,
    natural forcings, or regional human activities rather than attributed solely to global human influence.

    Observed changes in regional climate have affected many physical                                                        Q2.20 & Q2.25
    and biological systems, and there are preliminary indications that
    social and economic systems have been affected.

measured changes can provide insight to the underlying causes of the major changes. A climate model
can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The
simulations represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic
activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases
and an estimate of sulfate aerosols. And those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural
and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can be seen that the inclusion of anthropogenic forcings
provides a plausible explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature changes over the past
century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors
are included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but
do not exclude the possibility that other forcings may also have contributed.



Recent regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have                                                Q2.21-24
already affected hydrological systems and terrestrial and marine ecosystems in
many parts of the world (see Table SPM-1). The observed changes in these systems1 are
coherent across diverse localities and/or regions and are consistent in direction with the expected
effects of regional changes in temperature. The probability that the observed changes in the expected
direction (with no reference to magnitude) could occur by chance alone is negligible.

    There are 44 regional studies of over 400 plants and animals, which varied in length from about 20 to 50 years,
    mainly from North America, Europe, and the southern polar region. There are 16 regional studies covering about
    100 physical processes over most regions of the world, which varied in length from about 20 to 150 years.

    The rising socio-economic costs related to weather damage and to regional variations                                                  Q2.25-26
    in climate suggest increasing vulnerability to climate change. Preliminary indications
    suggest that some social and economic systems have been affected by recent increases in floods
    and droughts, with increases in economic losses for catastrophic weather events. However, because
    these systems are also affected by changes in socio-economic factors such as demographic shifts
    and land-use changes, quantifying the relative impact of climate change (either anthropogenic or
    natural) and socio-economic factors is difficult.




                                                                                                                                                 Q3
    Question 3

    What is known about the regional and global climatic, environmental, and
    socio-economic consequences in the next 25, 50, and 100 years associated
    with a range of greenhouse gas emissions arising from scenarios used in
    the TAR (projections which involve no climate policy intervention)?

    To the extent possible evaluate the:
     • Projected changes in atmospheric concentrations, climate, and sea level
     • Impacts and economic costs and benefits of changes in climate and
       atmospheric composition on human health, diversity and productivity of
       ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors (particularly agriculture
       and water)
     • The range of options for adaptation, including the costs, benefits, and
       challenges
     • Development, sustainability, and equity issues associated with impacts
       and adaptation at a regional and global level.


    Carbon dioxide concentrations, globally averaged surface temperature,                                                                 Q3.2
    and sea level are projected to increase under all IPCC emissions scenarios
    during the 21st century.2

    For the six illustrative SRES emissions scenarios, the projected concentration of                                                     Q3.3-5
    CO2 in the year 2100 ranges from 540 to 970 ppm, compared to about 280 ppm in
    the pre-industrial era and about 368 ppm in the year 2000. The different socio-economic
    assumptions (demographic, social, economic, and technological) result in the different levels of
    future greenhouse gases and aerosols. Further uncertainties, especially regarding the persistence
    of the present removal processes (carbon sinks) and the magnitude of the climate feedback on the
    terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of about −10 to +30% in the year 2100 concentration, around
    each scenario. Therefore, the total range is 490 to 1,250 ppm (75 to 350% above the year 1750 (pre-
    industrial) concentration). Concentrations of the primary non-CO2 greenhouse gases by year 2100
    are projected to vary considerably across the six illustrative SRES scenarios (see Figure SPM-3).

    Projections using the SRES emissions scenarios in a range of climate models                                                           Q3.6-7 & Q3.11
    result in an increase in globally averaged surface temperature of 1.4 to 5.8°C over
    the period 1990 to 2100. This is about two to ten times larger than the central value
    of observed warming over the 20th century and the projected rate of warming is
    very likely to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years, based on
    paleoclimate data. Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those in the Second
    Assessment Report (SAR), which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on six IS92 scenarios. The higher
    projected temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to lower projected sulfur dioxide
    (SO2) emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to the IS92 scenarios. For the periods 1990 to
    2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected increases are 0.4 to 1.1°C and 0.8 to 2.6°C, respectively. By

the year 2100, the range in the surface temperature response across different climate models for
the same emissions scenario is comparable to the range across different SRES emissions scenarios
for a single climate model. Figure SPM-3 shows that the SRES scenarios with the highest emissions
result in the largest projected temperature increases. Nearly all land areas will very likely warm
more than these global averages, particularly those at northern high latitudes in winter.

Globally averaged annual precipitation is projected to increase during the 21st                                                 Q3.8 & Q3.12
century, though at regional scales both increases and decreases are projected of
typically 5 to 20%. It is likely that precipitation will increase over high-latitude regions in both
summer and winter. Increases are also projected over northern mid-latitudes, tropical Africa, and
Antarctica in winter, and in southern and eastern Asia in summer. Australia, Central America, and
southern Africa show consistent decreases in winter rainfall. Larger year-to-year variations in
precipitation are very likely over most areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected.

Glaciers are projected to continue their widespread retreat during the 21st century.                                            Q3.14
Northern Hemisphere snow cover, permafrost, and sea-ice extent are projected to decrease further.
The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass, while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass
(see Question 4).

Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m between the years 1990                                             Q3.9 & Q3.13
and 2100, for the full range of SRES scenarios, but with significant regional
variations. This rise is due primarily to thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers
and ice caps. For the periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected rises are 0.03 to 0.14
m and 0.05 to 0.32 m, respectively.

Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on                                                            Q3.15
both environmental and socio-economic systems, but the larger the
changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse effects
predominate.

The severity of the adverse impacts will be larger for greater cumulative emissions                                             Q3.16
of greenhouse gases and associated changes in climate (medium confidence). While
beneficial effects can be identified for some regions and sectors for small amounts of climate change,
these are expected to diminish as the magnitude of climate change increases. In contrast many
identified adverse effects are expected to increase in both extent and severity with the degree of
climate change. When considered by region, adverse effects are projected to predominate for much
of the world, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.

Overall, climate change is projected to increase threats to human health, particularly                                          Q3.17
in lower income populations, predominantly within tropical/subtropical countries.
Climate change can affect human health directly (e.g., reduced cold stress in temperate countries
but increased heat stress, loss of life in floods and storms) and indirectly through changes in the
ranges of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes),3 water-borne pathogens, water quality, air quality,
and food availability and quality (medium to high confidence). The actual health impacts will be
strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and socio-economic circumstances, and by
the range of social, institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptations taken to reduce the full
range of threats to health.

Ecological productivity and biodiversity will be altered by climate change and sea-                                             Q3.18-20

medium confidence). Significant disruptions of ecosystems from disturbances such as fire,
drought, pest infestation, invasion of species, storms, and coral bleaching events are expected to

    Eight studies have modeled the effects of climate change on these diseases—five on malaria and three on dengue.
    Seven use a biological or process-based approach, and one uses an empirical, statistical approach.

future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. These emissions in turn change the concentration of these gases and
aerosols in the atmosphere, leading to changed radiative forcing of the climate system. Radiative forcing due to the SRES scenarios results in projected
increases in temperature and sea level, which in turn will cause impacts. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives and no
probabilities of occurrence are assigned. Because the SRES scenarios had only been available for a very short time prior to production of the TAR,
the impacts assessments here use climate model results that tend to be based on equilibrium climate change scenarios (e.g., 2xCO2), a relatively
small number of experiments using a 1% per year CO2 increase transient scenario, or the scenarios used in the SAR (i.e., the IS92 series). Impacts
in turn can affect socio-economic development paths through, for example, adaptation and mitigation. The highlighted boxes along the top of the
figure illustrate how the various aspects relate to the integrated assessment framework for considering climate change (see Figure SPM-1).

     increase. The stresses caused by climate change, when added to other stresses on ecological systems,
     threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique systems and extinction of some
     endangered species. The effect of increasing CO2 concentrations will increase net primary
     productivity of plants, but climate changes, and the changes in disturbance regimes associated
     with them, may lead to either increased or decreased net ecosystem productivity (medium
     confidence). Some global models project that the net uptake of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems
     will increase during the first half of the 21st century but then level off or decline.

     Models of cereal crops indicate that in some temperate areas potential yields increase                            Q3.21
     with small increases in temperature but decrease with larger temperature changes
     (medium to low confidence). In most tropical and subtropical regions, potential yields
     are projected to decrease for most projected increases in temperature (medium
     confidence). Where there is also a large decrease in rainfall in subtropical and tropical dryland/
     rainfed systems, crop yields would be even more adversely affected. These estimates include some
     adaptive responses by farmers and the beneficial effects of CO2 fertilization, but not the impact of
     projected increases in pest infestations and changes in climate extremes. The ability of livestock
     producers to adapt their herds to the physiological stresses associated with climate change is
     poorly known. Warming of a few °C or more is projected to increase food prices globally, and may
     increase the risk of hunger in vulnerable populations.

     Climate change will exacerbate water shortages in many water-scarce areas of the                                  Q3.22
     world. Demand for water is generally increasing due to population growth and economic
     development, but is falling in some countries because of increased efficiency of use. Climate
     change is projected to substantially reduce available water (as reflected by projected runoff) in
     many of the water-scarce areas of the world, but to increase it in some other areas (medium
     confidence) (see Figure SPM-4). Freshwater quality generally would be degraded by higher water
     temperatures (high confidence), but this may be offset in some regions by increased flows.

     The aggregated market sector effects, measured as changes in gross domestic                                       Q3.25
     product (GDP), are estimated to be negative for many developing countries for all
     magnitudes of global mean temperature increases studied (low confidence), and
     are estimated to be mixed for developed countries for up to a few °C warming (low
     confidence) and negative for warming beyond a few degrees (medium to low
     confidence). The estimates generally exclude the effects of changes in climate variability and
     extremes, do not account for the effects of different rates of climate change, only partially account
     for impacts on goods and services that are not traded in markets, and treat gains for some as
     canceling out losses for others.

     Populations that inhabit small islands and/or low-lying coastal areas are at particular                           Q3.23
     risk of severe social and economic effects from sea-level rise and storm surges.
     Many human settlements will face increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, and tens of
     millions of people living in deltas, in low-lying coastal areas, and on small islands will face risk of
     displacement. Resources critical to island and coastal populations such as beaches, freshwater,
     fisheries, coral reefs and atolls, and wildlife habitat would also be at risk.

     The impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately upon developing countries                              Q3.33
     and the poor persons within all countries, and thereby exacerbate inequities in
     health status and access to adequate food, clean water, and other resources.
     Populations in developing countries are generally exposed to relatively high risks of adverse impacts
     from climate change. In addition, poverty and other factors create conditions of low adaptive
     capacity in most developing countries.

runoff for the years 1961 to 1990, largely follow projected changes in precipitation. Changes in runoff
are calculated with a hydrologic model using as inputs climate projections from two versions of the Hadley
Centre atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) for a scenario of 1% per annum increase in
effective CO2 concentration in the atmosphere: (a) HadCM2 ensemble mean and (b) HadCM3. Projected
increases in runoff in high latitudes and southeast Asia and decreases in central Asia, the area around the
Mediterranean, southern Africa, and Australia are broadly consistent across the Hadley Centre experiments,
and with the precipitation projections of other AOGCM experiments. For other areas of the world, changes in
precipitation and runoff are scenario- and model-dependent.

     Greater and more rapid climate change would pose greater challenges for adaptation                                   Q3.28
     and greater risks of damages than would lesser and slower change. Natural and
     human systems have evolved capabilities to cope with a range of climate variability within which
     the risks of damage are relatively low and ability to recover is high. However, changes in climate
     that result in increased frequency of events that fall outside the historic range with which systems
     have coped increase the risk of severe damages and incomplete recovery or collapse of the system.

            polar ice and permafrost? If so, can the risk be quantified?
     d.     The risk of abrupt or non-linear changes in ecological systems?

     is projected to be a decrease in diurnal temperature range in many areas, decrease of daily variability
     of surface air temperature in winter, and increased daily variability in summer in the Northern
     Hemisphere land areas. Many models project more El Niño-like mean conditions in the tropical
     Pacific. There is no clear agreement concerning changes in frequency or structure of naturally
     occurring atmosphere-ocean circulation patterns such as that of the North Atlantic Oscillation
     (NAO).

     more hot days, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, and fewer cold days. Many
     of these projected changes would lead to increased risks of floods and droughts in many regions,
     and predominantly adverse impacts on ecological systems, socio-economic sectors, and human
     health (see Table SPM-2 for details). High resolution modeling studies suggest that peak wind and

the projected changes is expected to increase with the rate, magnitude, and duration of climate
change. Examples of these types of changes include:
  • Large climate-induced changes in soils and vegetation may be possible and could induce further
    climate change through increased emissions of greenhouse gases from plants and soil, and
    changes in surface properties (e.g., albedo).
  • Most models project a weakening of the thermohaline circulation of the oceans resulting in a
    reduction of heat transport into high latitudes of Europe, but none show an abrupt shutdown by
    the end of the 21st century. However, beyond the year 2100, some models suggest that the
    thermohaline circulation could completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut down in either
    hemisphere if the change in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough.
  • The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to increase in mass during the 21st century, but after sustained
    warming the ice sheet could lose significant mass and contribute several meters to the projected
    sea-level rise over the next 1,000 years.
  • In contrast to the Antarctic ice sheet, the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass during the
    21st century and contribute a few cm to sea-level rise. Ice sheets will continue to react to
    climate warming and contribute to sea-level rise for thousands of years after climate has been
    stabilized. Climate models indicate that the local warming over Greenland is likely to be one
    to three times the global average. Ice sheet models project that a local warming of larger than

        3°C, if sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice
        sheet with a resulting sea-level rise of about 7 m. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for
        1,000 years, would likely result in a contribution from Greenland of about 3 m to sea-level rise.
      • Continued warming would increase melting of permafrost in polar, sub-polar, and mountain
        regions and would make much of this terrain vulnerable to subsidence and landslides which
        affect infrastructure, water courses, and wetland ecosystems.

     Changes in climate could increase the risk of abrupt and non-linear changes in many                              Q4.17-19
     ecosystems, which would affect their function, biodiversity, and productivity. The
     greater the magnitude and rate of the change, the greater the risk of adverse impacts. For example:
      • Changes in disturbance regimes and shifts in the location of suitable climatically defined habitats
        may lead to abrupt breakdown of terrestrial and marine ecosystems with significant changes in
        composition and function and increased risk of extinctions.
      • Sustained increases in water temperatures of as little as 1°C, alone or in combination with any
        of several stresses (e.g., excessive pollution and siltation), can lead to corals ejecting their
        algae (coral bleaching) and the eventual death of some corals.
      • Temperature increase beyond a threshold, which varies by crop and variety, can affect key
        development stages of some crops (e.g., spikelet sterility in rice, loss of pollen viability in
        maize, tubers’ development in potatoes) and thus the crop yields. Yield losses in these crops
        can be severe if temperatures exceed critical limits for even short periods.

     What is known about the inertia and time scales associated with the
     changes in the climate system, ecological systems, and socio-economic
     sectors and their interactions?


     Inertia is a widespread inherent characteristic of the interacting                                               Q5.1-4, Q5.8, Q5.10-12,

     climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems. Thus some impacts
     of anthropogenic climate change may be slow to become apparent,
     and some could be irreversible if climate change is not limited in
     both rate and magnitude before associated thresholds, whose
     positions may be poorly known, are crossed.

     Inertia in Climate Systems

     Stabilization of CO2 emissions at near-current levels will not lead to stabilization of                          Q5.3 & Q5.5
     CO2 atmospheric concentration, whereas stabilization of emissions of shorter lived
     greenhouse gases such as CH4 leads, within decades, to stabilization of their
     atmospheric concentrations. Stabilization of CO2 concentrations at any level requires eventual
     reduction of global CO2 net emissions to a small fraction of the current emission level. The lower
     the chosen level for stabilization, the sooner the decline in global net CO2 emissions needs to
     begin (see Figure SPM-5).

     After stabilization of the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse                                 Q5.4
     gases, surface air temperature is projected to continue to rise by a few tenths of a
     degree per century for a century or more, while sea level is projected to continue to
     rise for many centuries (see Figure SPM-5). The slow transport of heat into the oceans and slow
     response of ice sheets means that long periods are required to reach a new climate system equilibrium.

     Some changes in the climate system, plausible beyond the 21st century, would be                                  Q5.4 & Q5.14-16
     effectively irreversible. For example, major melting of the ice sheets (see Question 4) and
     fundamental changes in the ocean circulation pattern (see Question 4) could not be reversed over

a period of many human generations. The threshold for fundamental changes in the ocean circulation
may be reached at a lower degree of warming if the warming is rapid rather than gradual.

Inertia in Ecological Systems

Some ecosystems show the effects of climate change quickly, while others do so                                                  Q5.8 & Q3 Table 3-2
more slowly. For example, coral bleaching can occur in a single exceptionally warm season, while
long-lived organisms such as trees may be able to persist for decades under a changed climate, but be
unable to regenerate. When subjected to climate change, including changes in the frequency of extreme
events, ecosystems may be disrupted as a consequence of differences in response times of species.

Some carbon cycle models project the global terrestrial carbon net uptake peaks                                                 Q5.6-7
during the 21st century, then levels off or declines. The recent global net uptake of CO2 by
terrestrial ecosystems is partly the result of time lags between enhanced plant growth and plant death
and decay. Current enhanced plant growth is partly due to fertilization effects of elevated CO2 and
nitrogen deposition, and changes in climate and land-use practices. The uptake will decline as
forests reach maturity, fertilization effects saturate, and decomposition catches up with growth. Climate
change is likely to further reduce net terrestrial carbon uptake globally. Although warming reduces
the uptake of CO2 by the ocean, the oceanic carbon sink is projected to persist under rising atmospheric
CO2, at least for the 21st century. Movement of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean takes
centuries, and its equilibration there with ocean sediments takes millennia.

     Inertia in Socio-Economic Systems

     Unlike the climate and ecological systems, inertia in human systems is not fixed; it                             Q5.10-13
     can be changed by policies and the choices made by individuals. The capacity for
     implementing climate change policies depends on the interaction between social and economic
     structures and values, institutions, technologies, and established infrastructure. The combined
     system generally evolves relatively slowly. It can respond quickly under pressure, although
     sometimes at high cost (e.g., if capital equipment is prematurely retired). If change is slower, there
     may be lower costs due to technological advancement or because capital equipment value is fully
     depreciated. There is typically a delay of years to decades between perceiving a need to respond
     to a major challenge, planning, researching and developing a solution, and implementing it.
     Anticipatory action, based on informed judgment, can improve the chance that appropriate
     technology is available when needed.

     The development and adoption of new technologies can be accelerated by technology                                Q5.10 & Q5.22
     transfer and supportive fiscal and research policies. Technology replacement can be delayed
     by “locked-in” systems that have market advantages arising from existing institutions, services,
     infrastructure, and available resources. Early deployment of rapidly improving technologies allows
     learning-curve cost reductions.

     Policy Implications of Inertia

     Inertia and uncertainty in the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems imply                             Q5.18-20 & Q5.23
     that safety margins should be considered in setting strategies, targets, and time tables
     for avoiding dangerous levels of interference in the climate system. Stabilization target
     levels of, for instance, atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature, or sea level may be affected by:
       • The inertia of the climate system, which will cause climate change to continue for a period
         after mitigation actions are implemented
       • Uncertainty regarding the location of possible thresholds of irreversible change and the behavior
         of the system in their vicinity
       • The time lags between adoption of mitigation goals and their achievement.
     Similarly, adaptation is affected by the time lags involved in identifying climate change impacts,
     developing effective adaptation strategies, and implementing adaptive measures.

     Inertia in the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems makes adaptation                                  Q5.18-21
     inevitable and already necessary in some cases, and inertia affects the optimal
     mix of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Inertia has different consequences for adaptation
     than for mitigation—with adaptation being primarily oriented to address localized impacts of
     climate change, while mitigation aims to address the impacts on the climate system. These
     consequences have bearing on the most cost-effective and equitable mix of policy options. Hedging
     strategies and sequential decision making (iterative action, assessment, and revised action) may
     be appropriate responses to the combination of inertia and uncertainty. In the presence of inertia,
     well-founded actions to adapt to or mitigate climate change are more effective, and in some
     circumstances may be cheaper, if taken earlier rather than later.

     The pervasiveness of inertia and the possibility of irreversibility in the interacting                           Q5.24
     climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems are major reasons why anticipatory
     adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial. A number of opportunities to exercise
     adaptation and mitigation options may be lost if action is delayed.

a)     How does the extent and timing of the introduction of a range of
       emissions reduction actions determine and affect the rate, magnitude,
       and impacts of climate change, and affect the global and regional
       economy, taking into account the historical and current emissions?

b)     What is known from sensitivity studies about regional and global
       climatic, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of stabilizing
       the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (in carbon
       dioxide equivalents), at a range of levels from today’s to double that
       level or more, taking into account to the extent possible the effects of
       aerosols? For each stabilization scenario, including different pathways
       to stabilization, evaluate the range of costs and benefits, relative to
       the range of scenarios considered in Question 3, in terms of:
        • Projected changes in atmospheric concentrations, climate, and
          sea level, including changes beyond 100 years
        • Impacts and economic costs and benefits of changes in climate
          and atmospheric composition on human health, diversity and
          productivity of ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors
          (particularly agriculture and water)
        • The range of options for adaptation, including the costs, benefits,
          and challenges
        • The range of technologies, policies, and practices that could be
          used to achieve each of the stabilization levels, with an evaluation
          of the national and global costs and benefits, and an assessment
          of how these costs and benefits would compare, either qualitatively
          or quantitatively, to the avoided environmental harm that would
          be achieved by the emissions reductions
        • Development, sustainability, and equity issues associated with
          impacts, adaptation, and mitigation at a regional and global level.


The projected rate and magnitude of warming and sea-level rise can                                                 Q6.2
be lessened by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The greater the reductions in emissions and the earlier they are introduced, the smaller                           Q6.3
and slower the projected warming and the rise in sea levels. Future climate change is
determined by historic, current, and future emissions. Differences in projected temperature changes
between scenarios that include greenhouse gas emission reductions and those that do not tend to
be small for the first few decades but grow with time if the reductions are sustained.

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that control their concentration                              Q6.4
would be necessary to stabilize radiative forcing. For example, for the most important
anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric
CO2 concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO2 emissions
to drop below the year 1990 levels, within a few decades, about a century, or about 2 centuries,
respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter (see Figure SPM-6). These models illustrate
that emissions would peak in about 1 to 2 decades (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm)
from the present. Eventually CO2 emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of
current emissions. The benefits of different stabilization levels are discussed later in Question 6
and the costs of these stabilization levels are discussed in Question 7.

There is a wide band of uncertainty in the amount of warming that would result                                     Q6.5
from any stabilized greenhouse gas concentration. This results from the factor of three

     current levels and would slow the rate of warming.
     a) CO2 emissions: The time paths of CO2 emissions that would lead to stabilization of the concentration of
         CO2 in the atmosphere at various levels are estimated for the WRE stabilization profiles using carbon
         cycle models. The shaded area illustrates the range of uncertainty.
     b) CO2 concentrations: The CO2 concentrations specified for the WRE profiles are shown.
     c) Global mean temperature changes: Temperature changes are estimated using a simple climate model for
         the WRE stabilization profiles. Warming continues after the time at which the CO2 concentration is stabilized
         (indicated by black spots), but at a much diminished rate. It is assumed that emissions of gases other than
         CO2 follow the SRES A1B projection until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter. This scenario was
         chosen as it is in the middle of the range of SRES scenarios. The dashed lines show the temperature
         changes projected for the S profiles (not shown in panels (a) or (b)). The shaded area illustrates the effect of
         a range of climate sensitivity across the five stabilization cases. The colored bars on the righthand side
         show uncertainty for each stabilization case at the year 2300. The diamonds on the righthand side show
         the average equilibrium (very long-term) warming for each CO2 stabilization level. Also shown for comparison
         are CO2 emissions, concentrations, and temperature changes for three of the SRES scenarios.

         The equilibrium global mean temperature response to doubling atmospheric CO2 is often used as a measure of
         climate sensitivity. The temperatures shown in Figures SPM-6 and SPM-7 are derived from a simple model
         calibrated to give the same response as a number of complex models that have climate sensitivities ranging from
         1.7 to 4.2°C. This range is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C.

Emission reductions that would eventually stabilize the atmospheric concentration                                               Q6.6
of CO2 at a level below 1,000 ppm, based on profiles shown in Figure SPM-6, and
assuming that emissions of gases other than CO2 follow the SRES A1B projection
until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter, are estimated to limit global mean
temperature increase to 3.5°C or less through the year 2100. Global average surface
temperature is estimated to increase 1.2 to 3.5°C by the year 2100 for profiles that eventually
stabilize the concentration of CO2 at levels from 450 to 1,000 ppm. Thus, although all of the CO2
concentration stabilization profiles analyzed would prevent, during the 21st century, much of the
upper end of the SRES projections of warming (1.4 to 5.8°C by the year 2100), it should be noted
that for most of the profiles the concentration of CO2 would continue to rise beyond the year 2100.
The equilibrium temperature rise would take many centuries to reach, and ranges from 1.5 to
3.9°C above the year 1990 levels for stabilization at 450 ppm, and 3.5 to 8.7°C above the year
1990 levels for stabilization at 1,000 ppm.5 Furthermore, for a specific temperature stabilization
target there is a very wide range of uncertainty associated with the required stabilization level of
greenhouse gas concentrations (see Figure SPM-7). The level at which CO2 concentration is required
to be stabilized for a given temperature target also depends on the levels of the non-CO2 gases.

Sea level and ice sheets would continue to respond to warming for many centuries                                                Q6.8
after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized. The projected range of sea-
level rise due to thermal expansion at equilibrium is 0.5 to 2 m for an increase in CO2 concentration
from the pre-industrial level of 280 to 560 ppm and 1 to 4 m for an increase in CO2 concentration
from 280 to 1,120 ppm. The observed rise over the 20th century was 0.1 to 0.2 m. The projected
rise would be larger if the effect of increases in other greenhouse gas concentrations were to be taken
into account. There are other contributions to sea-level rise over time scales of centuries to millennia.
Models assessed in the TAR project sea-level rise of several meters from polar ice sheets (see
Question 4) and land ice even for stablization levels of 550 ppm CO2-equivalent.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to stabilize their atmospheric                                                           Q6.9
concentrations would delay and reduce damages caused by climate
change.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction (mitigation) actions would lessen the pressures                                               Q6.10
on natural and human systems from climate change. Slower rates of increase in global
mean temperature and sea level would allow more time for adaptation. Consequently, mitigation
actions are expected to delay and reduce damages caused by climate change and thereby generate
environmental and socio-economic benefits. Mitigation actions and their associated costs are
assessed in the response to Question 7.

Mitigation actions to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at                                               Q6.11
lower levels would generate greater benefits in terms of less damage. Stabilization at
lower levels reduces the risk of exceeding temperature thresholds in biophysical systems where
these exist. Stabilization of CO2 at, for example, 450 ppm is estimated to yield an increase in global
mean temperature in the year 2100 that is about 0.75 to 1.25oC less than is estimated for stabilization
at 1,000 ppm (see Figure SPM-7). At equilibrium the difference is about 2 to 5oC. The geographical
extent of the damage to or loss of natural systems, and the number of systems affected, which increase
with the magnitude and rate of climate change, would be lower for a lower stabilization level.
Similarly, for a lower stabilization level the severity of impacts from climate extremes is expected to be
less, fewer regions would suffer adverse net market sector impacts, global aggregate impacts would
be smaller, and risks of large-scale, high-impact events would be reduced.




5
    For all these scenarios, the contribution to the equilibrium warming from other greenhouse gases and aerosols is
    0.6°C for a low climate sensitivity and 1.4°C for a high climate sensitivity. The accompanying increase in radiative
    forcing is equivalent to that occurring with an additional 28% in the final CO2 concentrations.

     levels of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases do not yet exist. Advances
     have been made in understanding the qualitative character of the impacts of climate change. Because
     of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, and uncertainty about the geographic and seasonal patterns of
     projected changes in temperatures, precipitation, and other climate variables and phenomena, the
     impacts of climate change cannot be uniquely determined for individual emission scenarios. There
     are also uncertainties about key processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities of systems to
     changes in climate. In addition, impacts such as the changes in the composition and function of
     ecological systems, species extinction, and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution
     of impacts across different populations, are not readily expressed in monetary or other common
     units. Because of these limitations, the benefits of different greenhouse gas emission reduction actions,
     including actions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at selected levels, are incompletely
     characterized and cannot be compared directly to mitigation costs for the purpose of estimating
     the net economic effects of mitigation.

change risks. Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, even stabilization of their concentrations
in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether prevent climate change or sea-level rise
nor altogether prevent their impacts. Many reactive adaptations will occur in response to the
changing climate and rising seas and some have already occurred. In addition, the development of
planned adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize opportunities can complement mitigation
actions to lessen climate change impacts. However, adaptation would entail costs and cannot
prevent all damages. The costs of adaptation can be lessened by mitigation actions that will reduce
and slow the climate changes to which systems would otherwise be exposed.

The impact of climate change is projected to have different effects within and between                                  Q6.16-18
countries. The challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue
of equity. Mitigation and adaptation actions can, if appropriately designed, advance sustainable
development and equity both within and across countries and between generations. Reducing the projected
increase in climate extremes is expected to benefit all countries, particularly developing countries, which
are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries. Mitigating climate
change would also lessen the risks to future generations from the actions of the present generation.

Question 7

What is known about the potential for, and costs and benefits of, and time
frame for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?
  • What would be the economic and social costs and benefits and equity
    implications of options for policies and measures, and the mechanisms
    of the Kyoto Protocol, that might be considered to address climate
    change regionally and globally?
  • What portfolios of options of research and development, investments,
    and other policies might be considered that would be most effective to
    enhance the development and deployment of technologies that address
    climate change?
  • What kind of economic and other policy options might be considered to
    remove existing and potential barriers and to stimulate private- and
    public-sector technology transfer and deployment among countries, and
    what effect might these have on projected emissions?
  • How does the timing of the options contained in the above affect
    associated economic costs and benefits, and the atmospheric
    concentrations of greenhouse gases over the next century and beyond?


There are many opportunities, including technological options, to                                                       Q7.2-7
reduce near-term emissions, but barriers to their deployment exist.

Significant technical progress relevant to the potential for greenhouse gas emission                                    Q7.3
reductions has been made since the SAR in 1995, and has been faster than anticipated.
Net emissions reductions could be achieved through a portfolio of technologies (e.g., more efficient
conversion in production and use of energy, shift to low- or no-greenhouse gas-emitting technologies,
carbon removal and storage, and improved land use, land-use change, and forestry practices). Advances
are taking place in a wide range of technologies at different stages of development, ranging from
the market introduction of wind turbines and the rapid elimination of industrial by-product gases,
to the advancement of fuel cell technology and the demonstration of underground CO2 storage.

     The successful implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation options would need to                                               Q7.6
     overcome technical, economic, political, cultural, social, behavioral, and/or institutional
     barriers that prevent the full exploitation of the technological, economic, and social
     opportunities of these options. The potential mitigation opportunities and types of barriers
     vary by region and sector, and over time. This is caused by the wide variation in mitigative capacity.
     Most countries could benefit from innovative financing, social learning and innovation, institutional
     reforms, removing barriers to trade, and poverty eradication. In addition, in industrialized countries,
     future opportunities lie primarily in removing social and behavioral barriers; in countries with
     economies in transition, in price rationalization; and in developing countries, in price rationalization,
     increased access to data and information, availability of advanced technologies, financial resources,
     and training and capacity building. Opportunities for any given country, however, might be found
     in the removal of any combination of barriers.

     National responses to climate change can be more effective if deployed as a portfolio                                          Q7.7
     of policy instruments to limit or reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. The portfolio
     may include—according to national circumstances—emissions/carbon/energy taxes, tradable or
     non-tradable permits, land-use policies, provision and/or removal of subsidies, deposit/refund
     systems, technology or performance standards, energy mix requirement, product bans, voluntary
     agreements, government spending and investment, and support for research and development.

     Cost estimates by different models and studies vary for many reasons.                                                          Q7.14-19


     For a variety of reasons, significant differences and uncertainties surround specific                                          Q7.14 & Q7.20
     quantitative estimates of mitigation costs. Cost estimates differ because of the (a)
     methodology6 used in the analysis, and (b) underlying factors and assumptions
     built into the analysis. The inclusion of some factors will lead to lower estimates and others to
     higher estimates. Incorporating multiple greenhouse gases, sinks, induced technical change, and
     emissions trading7 can lower estimated costs. Further, studies suggest that some sources of
     greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at no, or negative, net social cost to the extent that policies
     can exploit no-regrets opportunities such as correcting market imperfections, inclusion of ancillary
     benefits, and efficient tax revenue recycling. International cooperation that facilitates cost-effective
     emissions reductions can lower mitigation costs. On the other hand, accounting for potential short-
     term macro shocks to the economy, constraints on the use of domestic and international market
     mechanisms, high transaction costs, inclusion of ancillary costs, and ineffective tax recycling
     measures can increase estimated costs. Since no analysis incorporates all relevant factors affecting
     mitigation costs, estimated costs may not reflect the actual costs of implementing mitigation actions.

     Studies examined in the TAR suggest substantial opportunities for                                                              Q7.15-16
     lowering mitigation costs.

     Bottom-up studies indicate that substantial low cost mitigation opportunities exist.                                           Q7.15 & Q7 Table 7-1
     According to bottom-up studies, global emissions reductions of 1.9–2.6 Gt Ceq (gigatonnes of carbon
     equivalent), and 3.6–5.0 Gt Ceq per year8 could be achieved by the years 2010 and 2020, respectively.
     Half of these potential emissions reductions could be achieved by the year 2020 with direct benefits
     (energy saved) exceeding direct costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs), and the other
     half at a net direct cost of up to US$100 per t Ceq (at 1998 prices). These net direct cost estimates

     6
       The SAR described two categories of approaches to estimating costs: bottom-up approaches, which build up
       from assessments of specific technologies and sectors, and top-down modeling studies, which proceed from
       macro-economic relationships. See Box 7-1 in the underlying report.
     7
       A market-based approach to achieving environmental objectives that allows those reducing greenhouse gas
       emissions, below what is required, to use or trade the excess reductions to offset emissions at another source
       inside or outside the country. Here the term is broadly used to include trade in emission allowances, and project-
       based collaboration.
     8
       The emissions reduction estimates are with reference to a baseline trend that is similar in magnitude to the SRES
       B2 scenario.

are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to 12%, consistent with public sector discount rates.
Private internal rates of return vary greatly, and are often significantly higher, affecting the rate of
adoption of these technologies by private entities. Depending on the emissions scenario this could
allow global emissions to be reduced below year 2000 levels in 2010–2020 at these net direct cost
estimates. Realizing these reductions involves additional implementation costs, which in some cases
may be substantial, the possible need for supporting policies, increased research and development,
effective technology transfer, and overcoming other barriers. The various global, regional, national,
sector, and project studies assessed in the WGIII TAR have different scopes and assumptions.
Studies do not exist for every sector and region.

Forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer significant carbon                                        Q7.4 & Q7.16
mitigation potential. Conservation and sequestration of carbon, although not
necessarily permanent, may allow time for other options to be further developed
and implemented. Biological mitigation can occur by three strategies: (a) conservation of existing
carbon pools, (b) sequestration by increasing the size of carbon pools,9 and (c) substitution of
sustainably produced biological products. The estimated global potential of biological mitigation
options is on the order of 100 Gt C (cumulative) by year 2050, equivalent to about 10 to 20% of
projected fossil-fuel emissions during that period, although there are substantial uncertainties
associated with this estimate. Realization of this potential depends upon land and water availability
as well as the rates of adoption of land management practices. The largest biological potential for
atmospheric carbon mitigation is in subtropical and tropical regions. Cost estimates reported to
date for biological mitigation vary significantly from US$0.1 to about US$20 per t C in several
tropical countries and from US$20 to US$100 per t C in non-tropical countries. Methods of financial
analyses and carbon accounting have not been comparable. Moreover, the cost calculations do not
cover, in many instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate discounting, monitoring,
data collection and implementation costs, opportunity costs of land and maintenance, or other
recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. The lower end of the range is assessed to
be biased downwards, but understanding and treatment of costs is improving over time. Biological
mitigation options may reduce or increase non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions.

The cost estimates for Annex B countries to implement the Kyoto Protocol vary                                                 Q7.17-18
between studies and regions, and depend strongly, among others, upon the
assumptions regarding the use of the Kyoto mechanisms, and their interactions
with domestic measures (see Figure SPM-8 for comparison of regional Annex II
mitigation costs). The great majority of global studies reporting and comparing these costs use
international energy-economic models. Nine of these studies suggest the following GDP impacts.
In the absence of emissions trade between Annex B countries, these studies show reductions in
projected GDP10 of about 0.2 to 2% in the year 2010 for different Annex II regions. With full
emissions trading between Annex B countries, the estimated reductions in the year 2010 are between
0.1 and 1.1% of projected GDP. The global modeling studies reported above show national marginal
costs to meet the Kyoto targets from about US$20 up to US$600 per t C without trading, and a
range from about US$15 up to US$150 per t C with Annex B trading. For most economies-in-
transition countries, GDP effects range from negligible to a several percent increase. However, for
some economies-in-transition countries, implementing the Kyoto Protocol will have similar impact
on GDP as for Annex II countries. At the time of these studies, most models did not include sinks,
non-CO2 greenhouse gases, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), negative cost options,

   Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO2 concentration. Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released
   by historical land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere over the course of the century (e.g.,
   by reforestation), CO2 concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm.
10
   The calculated GDP reductions are relative to each model’s projected GDP baseline. The models evaluated only
   reductions in CO2. In contrast, the estimates cited from the bottom-up analyses above included all greenhouse
   gases. Many metrics can be used to present costs. For example, if the annual costs to developed countries
   associated with meeting Kyoto targets with full Annex B trading are in the order of 0.5% of GDP, this represents
   US$125 billion (1,000 million) per year, or US$125 per person per year by 2010 in Annex II (SRES assumptions).
   This corresponds to an impact on economic growth rates over 10 years of less than 0.1 percentage point.

     region makes the prescribed reduction with only domestic trading in carbon emissions. In the second, Annex B trading is permitted, and thereby

ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling, the inclusion of which will reduce estimated
costs. On the other hand, these models make assumptions which underestimate costs because they
assume full use of emissions trading without transaction costs, both within and among Annex B
countries, that mitigation responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies begin to adjust
to the need to meet Kyoto targets between 1990 and 2000. The cost reductions from Kyoto mechanisms
may depend on the details of implementation, including the compatibility of domestic and
international mechanisms, constraints, and transaction costs.

Emission constraints on Annex I countries have well-established, albeit varied, “spill-                                 Q7.19
over” effects11 on non-Annex I countries. Analyses report reductions in both projected GDP
and reductions in projected oil revenues for oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries. The study reporting
the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of projected GDP with no emissions trading, and less than
0.05% of projected GDP with Annex B emissions trading in the year 2010.12 The study reporting the
highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected oil revenues with no emissions trading, and 13%
of projected oil revenues with Annex B emissions trading in the year 2010. These studies do not
consider policies and measures other than Annex B emissions trading, that could lessen the impacts
on non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries. The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content, increased
use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries.
Other non-Annex I countries may be adversely affected by reductions in demand for their exports
to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations and by the price
increase of those carbon-intensive and other products they continue to import. These other non-
Annex I countries may benefit from the reduction in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-
intensive products, and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how. The
possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-Annex I countries and wider impacts
on trade flows in response to changing prices may lead to carbon leakage13on the order of 5–20%.

Technology development and diffusion are important components                                                           Q7.9-12 & Q7.23
of cost-effective stabilization.

Development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies could play a critical                                    Q7.9-12 & Q7.23
role in reducing the cost of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Transfer of
technologies between countries and regions could widen the choice of options at the regional
level. Economies of scale and learning will lower the costs of their adoption. Through sound
economic policy and regulatory frameworks, transparency, and political stability, governments
could create an enabling environment for private- and public-sector technology transfers. Adequate
human and organizational capacity is essential at every stage to increase the flow, and improve the
quality, of technology transfer. In addition, networking among private and public stakeholders, and
focusing on products and techniques with multiple ancillary benefits, that meet or adapt to local
development needs and priorities, is essential for most effective technology transfers.

Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns of energy resource development                                     Q7.27
and an increase in energy research and development to assist accelerating the
development and deployment of advanced environmentally sound energy technologies.
Emissions of CO2 due to fossil-fuel burning are virtually certain to be the dominant influence on
the trend of atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. Resource data assessed in the
TAR may imply a change in the energy mix and the introduction of new sources of energy during
the 21st century. The choice of energy mix and associated technologies and investments—either

   These estimated costs can be expressed as differences in GDP growth rates over the period 2000–2010. With no
   emissions trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points per year; with Annex B emissions
   trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage points per year.

     non-fossil energy sources or fossil energy technology with carbon capture and storage—will
     determine whether, and if so, at what level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized.

     Both the pathway to stabilization and the stabilization level itself are                                                 Q7.24-25
     key determinants of mitigation costs.14

     The pathway to meeting a particular stabilization target will have an impact on                                          Q7.24
     mitigation cost (see Figure SPM-9). A gradual transition away from the world’s present
     energy system towards a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes costs associated with premature
     retirement of existing capital stock and provides time for technology development, and avoids
     premature lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing low-emission technology. On the other
     hand, more rapid near-term action would increase flexibility in moving towards stabilization,
     decrease environmental and human risks and the costs associated with projected changes in climate,
     may stimulate more rapid deployment of existing low-emission technologies, and provide strong
     near-term incentives to future technological changes.

     Studies show that the costs of stabilizing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere                                          Q7.25
     increase as the concentration stabilization level declines. Different baselines can
     have a strong influence on absolute costs (see Figure SPM-9). While there is a moderate
     increase in the costs when passing from a 750 to a 550 ppm concentration stabilization level, there is
     a larger increase in costs passing from 550 to 450 ppm unless the emissions in the baseline scenario are
     very low. Although model projections indicate long-term global growth paths of GDP are not significantly
     affected by mitigation actions towards stabilization, these do not show the larger variations that occur
     over some shorter time periods, sectors, or regions. These studies did not incorporate carbon sequestration
     and did not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced technological change.
     Also, the issue of uncertainty takes on increasing importance as the time frame is expanded.

Question 8

What is known about the interactions between projected human-induced
changes in climate and other environmental issues (e.g., urban air pollution,
regional acid deposition, loss of biological diversity, stratospheric ozone
depletion, and desertification and land degradation)? What is known about
environmental, social, and economic costs and benefits and implications
of these interactions for integrating climate change response strategies in
an equitable manner into broad sustainable development strategies at
the local, regional, and global scales?


Local, regional, and global environmental issues are inextricably linked                                            Q8.1-2
and affect sustainable development. Therefore, there are synergistic
opportunities to develop more effective response options to these
environmental issues that enhance benefits, reduce costs, and more
sustainably meet human needs.

Meeting human needs in many instances is causing environmental degradation,                                         Q8.3 & Q8.15
which in turn threatens the ability to meet present and future needs. For example,
increased agricultural production can be achieved through increased use of nitrogenous fertilizers,
irrigation, or the conversion of natural grasslands and forests to croplands. However, these changes
can affect the Earth’s climate through the release of greenhouse gases, lead to land degradation
through erosion and salinization of soils, and contribute to the loss of biodiversity and reduction
of carbon sequestration through the conversion and fragmentation of natural ecological systems.
Agricultural productivity can in turn be adversely affected by changes in climate, especially in the
tropics and subtropics, loss of biodiversity and changes at the genetic and species level, and land
degradation through loss of soil fertility. Many of these changes adversely affect food security and
disproportionately impact the poor.

The primary factors underlying anthropogenic climate change are similar to those                                    Q8.4
for most environmental and socio-economic issues—that is, economic growth,
broad technological changes, life style patterns, demographic shifts (population
size, age structure, and migration), and governance structures. These can give rise to:
 • Increased demand for natural resources and energy
 • Market imperfections, including subsidies that lead to the inefficient use of resources and act
   as a barrier to the market penetration of environmentally sound technologies; the lack of
   recognition of the true value of natural resources; failure to appropriate for the global values of
   natural resources at the local level; and failure to internalize the costs of environmental
   degradation into the market price of a resource
 • Limited availability and transfer of technology, inefficient use of technologies, and inadequate
   investment in research and development for the technologies of the future
 • Failure to manage adequately the use of natural resources and energy.

Climate change affects environmental issues such as loss of biodiversity,                                           Q8.5-20
desertification, stratospheric ozone depletion, freshwater availability, and air quality,
and in turn climate change is affected by many of these issues. For example, climate
change is projected to exacerbate local and regional air pollution and delay the recovery of the
stratospheric ozone layer. In addition, climate change could also affect the productivity and
composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems, with a potential loss in both genetic and
species diversity; could accelerate the rate of land degradation; and could exacerbate problems
related to freshwater quantity and quality in many areas. Conversely, local and regional air pollution,
stratospheric ozone depletion, changes in ecological systems, and land degradation would affect
the Earth’s climate by changing the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, radiative balance of
the atmosphere, and surface albedo.

     The linkages among local, regional, and global environmental issues, and their                                     Q8.21-25
     relationship to meeting human needs, offer opportunities to capture synergies in
     developing response options and reducing vulnerabilities to climate change,
     although trade-offs between issues may exist. Multiple environmental and development
     goals can be achieved by adopting a broad range of technologies, policies, and measures that explicitly
     recognize the inextricable linkages among environmental problems and human needs. Addressing
     the need for energy, while reducing local and regional air pollution and global climate change
     cost-effectively, requires an interdisciplinary assessment of the synergies and trade-offs of meeting
     energy requirements in the most economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable manner.
     Greenhouse gas emissions, as well as local and regional pollutants, could be reduced through more
     efficient use of energy and increasing the share of lower carbon-emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil-
     fuel technologies (e.g., highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines, fuel cells, and combined heat and
     power) and renewable energy technologies (e.g., increased use of environmentally sound biofuels,
     hydropower, solar, wind- and wave-power). Further, the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations
     in the atmosphere can be reduced also by enhanced uptake of carbon through, for example,
     afforestation, reforestation, slowing deforestation, and improved forest, rangeland, wetland, and
     cropland management, which can have favorable effects on biodiversity, food production, land,
     and water resources. Reducing vulnerability to climate change can often reduce vulnerability to
     other environmental stresses and vice versa. In some cases there will be trade-offs. For example,
     in some implementations, monoculture plantations could decrease local biodiversity.

     The capacity of countries to adapt and mitigate can be enhanced when climate                                       Q8.26-27
     policies are integrated with national development policies including economic,
     social, and other environmental dimensions. Climate mitigation and adaptation options can
     yield ancillary benefits that meet human needs, improve well-being, and bring other environmental
     benefits. Countries with limited economic resources and low level of technology are often highly
     vulnerable to climate change and other environmental problems.

     A great deal of interaction exists among the environmental issues that multilateral                                Q8.11 & Q8.28
     environmental agreements address, and synergies can be exploited in their
     implementation. Global environmental problems are addressed in a range of individual conventions
     and agreements, as well as a range of regional agreements. They may contain, inter alia, matters of
     common interest and similar requirements for enacting general objectives—for example, implementation
     plans, data collection and processing, strengthening human and infrastructural capacity, and reporting
     obligations. For example, although different, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone
     Layer and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are scientifically interrelated
     because many of the compounds that cause depletion of the ozone layer are also important greenhouse
     gases and because some of the substitutes for the now banned ozone-depleting substances are
     greenhouse gases.

robust findings in relation to the questions of this report. In the examples in Table SPM-3, many of
the robust findings relate to the existence of a climate response to human activities and the sign of
the response. Many of the key uncertainties are concerned with the quantification of the magnitude
and/or timing of the response. After addressing the attribution of climate change, the table deals in
order with the issues illustrated in Figure SPM-1. Figure SPM-10 illustrates some of the main robust
findings regarding climate change. Table SPM-3 provides examples and is not an exhaustive list.

Significant progress has been made in the TAR in many aspects of the knowledge required to
understand climate change and the human response to it. However, there remain important areas
where further work is required, in particular:
 • The detection and attribution of climate change
 • The understanding and prediction of regional changes in climate and climate extremes
 • The quantification of climate change impacts at the global, regional, and local levels
 • The analysis of adaptation and mitigation activities
 • The integration of all aspects of the climate change issue into strategies for sustainable development
 • Comprehensive and integrated investigations to support the judgment as to what constitutes
   “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”

Question 1

What can scientific, technical, and socio-economic analyses contribute to
the determination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system as referred to in Article 2 of the
Framework Convention on Climate Change?

Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 2
“The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the
Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow
ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not
threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”

     1.1      Natural, technical, and social sciences can provide essential information and                                         WGII TAR Section 2.7 &
              evidence needed for decisions on what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic                                            WGIII TAR Chapter 10

              interference” with the climate system. At the same time, such decisions are
              value judgments determined through socio-political processes, taking into
              account considerations such as development, equity, and sustainability, as
              well as uncertainties and risk. Scientific evidence helps to reduce uncertainty and
              increase knowledge, and can serve as an input for considering precautionary measures.1
              Decisions are based on risk assessment, and lead to risk management choices by decision
              makers, about actions and policies.2

     1.2      The basis for determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic                                                   WGII TAR Chapter 18 &

              interference” will vary among regions, depending both on the local nature
              and consequences of climate change impacts, and also on the adaptive
              capacity available to cope with climate change. It also depends upon
              mitigative capacity, since the magnitude and the rate of change are both
              important. The consequent types of adaptation responses that will be selected depend on
              the effectiveness of various adaptation or mitigation responses in reducing vulnerabilities
              and improving the sustainability of life-support systems. There is no universally applicable
              best set of policies; rather, it is important to consider both the robustness of different policy
              measures against a range of possible future worlds, and the degree to which such climate-
              specific policies can be integrated with broader sustainable development policies.

     1.3      The Third Assessment Report (TAR) provides an assessment of new scientific                                            WGI TAR, WGII TAR, &
              information and evidence as an input for policy makers in their determination                                         WGIII TAR

              of what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
              system” with regard to: (1) the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system, (2)
              the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and (3) the potential for
              achieving a broad range of levels of concentrations through mitigation and information
              about how adaptation can reduce vulnerability.

     1.4      With regard to the magnitudes and rates of changes in the climate system,                                             WGI TAR
              the TAR provides scenario-based projections of future concentrations of
              greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global and regional patterns of changes
              and rates of change in temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and changes
              in extreme climate events. It also examines possibilities for abrupt and irreversible
              changes in ocean circulation and the major ice sheets.

     1.5      The TAR reviews the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate                                                 WGII TAR Chapter 19
              change. The TAR articulates five reasons for concern, regarding:
                • Risks to unique and threatened systems
                • Risks associated with extreme weather events
                • The distribution of impacts
                • Aggregate impacts
                • Risks of large-scale, high-impact events.
              Of great significance here is an assessment of the likelihood of the critical thresholds at
              which natural and human systems exhibit large-scale, abrupt, or irreversible changes in
              their response to a changing climate. Since no single indicator (e.g., a monetary unit) captures


     1
       Conditions that justify the adoption of precautionary measures are described in Article 3.3 of the United Nations
       Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
     2
       The risk associated with an event is most simply defined as the probability of that event, multiplied by the
       magnitude of its consequence. Various decision frameworks can facilitate climate risk assessment and management.
       These include, among others, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-attribute analysis, and
       tolerable windows. Such techniques help to differentiate the risk levels associated with alternative futures, but in
       all cases the analyses are marked by considerable uncertainties.



38       IPCC Third Assessment Report
  Synthesis Report                                                                                     Question 1




       the range of relevant risks presented by climate change, a variety of analytical approaches
       and criteria are required to assess impacts and facilitate decisions about risk management.

1.6    With regard to strategies for addressing climate change, the TAR provides                             WGII TAR Chapter 18 &
                                                                                                             WGIII TAR Chapter 2
       an assessment of the potential for achieving different levels of concentrations
       through mitigation and information about how adaptation can reduce
       vulnerability. The causality works in both directions. Different stabilization levels result
       from different emission scenarios, which are connected to underlying development paths.
       In turn, these development paths strongly affect adaptive capacity in any region. In this
       way adaptation and mitigation strategies are dynamically connected with changes in the
       climate system and the prospects for ecosystem adaptation, food production, and sustainable
       economic development.

1.7    An integrated view of climate change considers the dynamics of the complete cycle of                  WGII TAR Chapters 1 & 19,
       interlinked causes and effects across all sectors concerned. Figure 1-1 shows the cycle,              WGIII TAR Chapter 1, &
                                                                                                             SRES
       from the underlying driving forces of population, economy, technology, and governance,
       through greenhouse gas and other emissions, changes in the physical climate system,
       biophysical and human impacts, to adaptation and mitigation, and back to the driving forces.
       The figure presents a schematic view of an ideal “integrated assessment” framework, in
       which all the parts of the climate change problem interact mutually. Changes in one part of
       the cycle influence other components in a dynamic manner, through multiple paths. The
       TAR assesses new policy-relevant information and evidence with regard to all quadrants
       of Figure 1-1. In particular, a new contribution has been to fill in the bottom righthand
       quadrant of the figure by exploring alternative development paths and their relationship to
       greenhouse gas emissions, and by undertaking preliminary work on the linkage between
       adaptation, mitigation, and development paths. However, the TAR does not achieve a fully
       integrated assessment of climate change, because of the incomplete state of knowledge.

1.8    Climate change decision making is essentially a sequential process under                              WGI TAR, WGII TAR, &

       general uncertainties. Decision making has to deal with uncertainties including the
       risk of non-linear and/or irreversible changes and entails balancing the risk of either
       insufficient or excessive action, and involves careful consideration of the consequences
       (both environmental and economic), their likelihood, and society’s attitude towards risk.
       The latter is likely to vary from country to country and from generation to generation. The
       relevant question is “what is the best course for the near term given the expected long-term
       climate change and accompanying uncertainties.”

1.9    Climate change impacts are part of the larger question of how complex social,                         WGII TAR
       economic, and environmental subsystems interact and shape prospects for
       sustainable development. There are multiple links. Economic development affects
       ecosystem balance and, in turn, is affected by the state of the ecosystem; poverty can be
       both a result and a cause of environmental degradation; material- and energy-intensive life
       styles and continued high levels of consumption supported by non-renewable resources
       and rapid population growth are not likely to be consistent with sustainable development
       paths; and extreme socio-economic inequality within communities and between nations
       may undermine the social cohesion that would promote sustainability and make policy
       responses more effective. At the same time, socio-economic and technology policy decisions
       made for non-climate-related reasons have significant implications for climate policy and
       climate change impacts, as well as for other environmental issues (see Question 8). In
       addition, critical impact thresholds and vulnerability to climate change impacts are directly
       connected to environmental, social, and economic conditions and institutional capacity.

1.10   As a result, the effectiveness of climate policies can be enhanced when they                          WGIII TAR Section 10.3.2
       are integrated with broader strategies designed to make national and regional
       development paths more sustainable. This occurs because of the impacts of natural

     Figure 1-1: Climate change – an integrated framework. Schematic and simplified representation of an integrated assessment framework for
     considering anthropogenic climate change. The yellow arrows show a full clockwise cycle of cause and effect among the four quadrants shown
     in the figure, while the blue arrow indicates the societal response to climate change impacts. For both developed and developing countries,
     each socio-economic development path explored in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios has driving forces which give rise to
     emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and precursors—with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most important. The greenhouse gas emissions
     accumulate in the atmosphere, changing concentrations and disturbing the natural balances, depending on physical processes such as
     solar radiation, cloud formation, and rainfall. The aerosols also give rise to air pollution (e.g., acid rain) that damage human and the natural
     systems (not shown). The enhanced greenhouse effect will initiate climate changes well into the future with associated impacts on the
     natural and human systems. There is a possibility of some feedback between the changes in these systems and the climate (not shown),
     such as albedo effects from changing land use, and other, perhaps larger, interactions between the systems and atmospheric emissions (e.g.,
     effects of changes in land use (again not shown)). These changes will ultimately have effects on socio-economic development paths. The
     development paths also have direct effects on the natural systems (shown by the anti-clockwise arrow from the development box) such as
     changes in land use leading to deforestation. This figure illustrates that the various dimensions of the climate change issue exist in a dynamic
     cycle, characterized by significant time delays. Both emissions and impacts, for example, are linked in complex ways to underlying socio-
     economic and technological development paths. A major contribution of the TAR has been to explicitly consider the bottom righthand domain
     (shown as a rectangle) by examining the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and development paths (in SRES), and by assessing
     preliminary work on the linkage between adaptation, mitigation, and development paths (WGII and WGIII). However, the TAR does not achieve
     a fully integrated assessment of climate change, since not all components of the cycle were able to be linked dynamically. Adaptation and
     mitigation are shown as modifying the effects shown in the figure.

       climate variation and changes, climate policy responses, and associated socio-economic
       development will affect the ability of countries to achieve sustainable development goals,
       while the pursuit of those goals will in turn affect the opportunities for, and success of,
       climate policies. In particular, the socio-economic and technological characteristics of
       different development paths will strongly affect emissions, the rate and magnitude of climate
       change, climate change impacts, the capability to adapt, and the capacity to mitigate climate.
       The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, see Box 3-1) outlined multiple plausible

What is the evidence for, causes of, and consequences of changes in the
Earth’s climate since the pre-industrial era?

(a)   Has the Earth’s climate changed since the pre-industrial era at the
      regional and/or global scale? If so, what part, if any, of the observed
      changes can be attributed to human influence and what part, if any,
      can be attributed to natural phenomena? What is the basis for that
      attribution?
(b)   What is known about the environmental, social, and economic
      consequences of climate changes since the pre-industrial era with
      an emphasis on the last 50 years?

     2.1    This answer focuses on classical measures of climate (e.g., temperature, precipitation, sea level,
            plus extreme events including floods, droughts, and storms), on other components of the Earth’s
            climate system (e.g., greenhouse gases and aerosols, ecological systems), and on human
            health and socio-economic sectors. Climate change as defined in IPCC refers to statistically
            significant variations that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It
            includes shifts in the frequency and magnitude of sporadic weather events as well as the
            slow continuous rise in global mean surface temperature. Thus the discussion here includes
            climate-weather variations on all temporal and spatial scales, ranging from brief-lived severe
            storms to seasonal El Niño events, decadal droughts, and century shifts in temperature and
            ice cover. Although short-term climate variations are considered predominantly natural at present,
            their impacts are discussed in this question because they represent a class of changes that
            may become more prevalent in a future climate perturbed by human activities (see Question
            4). Attribution is used here as the process of establishing the most likely causes for the
            detected change with some defined level of confidence. The discussion includes both climate
            change that is attributable to human influence and climate change that may at present be
            natural but might in the future be modified through human influence (see Box 3-1).

     2.2    The Earth’s climate system has demonstrably changed on both
            global and regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some
            of these changes attributable to human activities.

     2.3    Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human
            activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are
            expected to affect the climate (see Table 2-1).

     2.4    Concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and their radiative forcings                                  WGI TAR Chapters 3 & 4,
                                                                                                                         & SRAGA
            have generally increased over the 20th century as a result of human activities.
            Almost all greenhouse gases reached their highest recorded levels in the 1990s and continue
            to increase (see Figure 2-1). Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have
            varied substantially during glacial-interglacial cycles over the past 420,000 years, but even
            the largest of these earlier values are much less than their current atmospheric concentrations.
            In terms of radiative forcing by greenhouse gases emitted through human activity, CO2 and
            CH4 are the first and second most important, respectively. From the years 1750 to 2000, the
            concentration of CO2 increased by 31±4%, and that of CH4 rose by 151±25% (see Box 2-1
            and Figure 2-1). These rates of increase are unprecedented. Fossil-fuel burning released on
            average 5.4 Gt C yr−1 during the 1980s, increasing to 6.3 Gt C yr−1 during the 1990s. About
            three-quarters of the increase in atmospheric CO2 during the 1990s was caused by fossil-
            fuel burning, with land-use change including deforestation responsible for the rest. Over
            the 19th and much of the 20th century the terrestrial biosphere has been a net source of
            atmospheric CO2, but before the end of the 20th century it had become a net sink. The
            increase in CH4 can be identified with emissions from energy use, livestock, rice agriculture,
            and landfills. Increases in the concentrations of other greenhouse gases—particularly
            tropospheric ozone (O3), the third most important—are directly attributable to fossil-fuel
            combustion as well as other industrial and agricultural emissions.

      Where appropriate, the authors of the Third Assessment Report assigned confidence levels that represent
      their collective judgment in the validity of a conclusion based on observational evidence, modeling
      results, and theory that they have examined. The following words have been used throughout the text
      of the Synthesis Report to the TAR relating to WGI findings: virtually certain (greater than 99%
      chance that a result is true); very likely (90–99% chance); likely (66–90% chance); medium likelihood
      (33–66% chance); unlikely (10–33% chance); very unlikely (1–10% chance); and exceptionally
      unlikely (less than 1% chance). An explicit uncertainty range (±) is a likely range. Estimates of
      confidence relating to WGII findings are: very high (95% or greater), high (67–95%), medium
      (33–67%), low (5–33%), and very low (5% or less). No confidence levels were assigned in WGIII.

       that from the direct effects of aerosols is negative (cooling) and smaller; whereas
       the negative forcing from the indirect effects of aerosols (on clouds and the
       hydrologic cycle) might be large but is not well quantified. Key anthropogenic and
       natural factors causing a change in radiative forcing from year 1750 to year 2000 are shown
       in Figure 2-2, where the factors whose radiative forcing can be quantified are marked by
       wide, colored bars. Only some of the aerosol effects are estimated here and denoted as ranges.
       Other factors besides atmospheric constituents—solar irradiance and land-use change—are
       also shown. Stratospheric aerosols from large volcanic eruptions have led to important, but
       brief-lived, negative forcings (particularly the periods 1880–1920 and 1960–1994), which
       are not important over the time scale since the pre-industrial era and not shown. The sum of

      Weather-related economic losses                  Global inflation-adjusted losses rose an order of magnitude over the last 40 years (see
                                                       Figure 2-7). Part of the observed upward trend is linked to socio-economic factors and
                                                       part is linked to climatic factors. [WGII TAR Sections 8.2.1 & 8.2.2]
      a    This table provides examples of key observed changes and is not an exhaustive list. It includes both changes attributable to anthropogenic
           climate change and those that may be caused by natural variations or anthropogenic climate change. Confidence levels are reported
           where they are explicitly assessed by the relevant Working Group.



               quantified factors in Figure 2-2 (greenhouse gases, aerosols and clouds, land-use (albedo), and
               solar irradiance) is positive, but this does not include the potentially large, negative forcing
               from aerosol indirect effects. The total change in radiative forcing since the pre-industrial era
               continues to be a useful tool to estimate, to a first order, the global mean surface temperature
               response to human and natural perturbations; however, the sum of forcings is not necessarily
               an indicator of the detailed aspects of the potential climate responses such as regional
               climate change. For the last half of the 20th century (not shown), the positive forcing due to
               well-mixed greenhouse gases has increased rapidly over the past 4 decades, while in contrast
               the sum of natural forcings has been negative over the past 2 and possibly even 4 decades.

     2.6       An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture
               of a warming world and other changes in the climate system
               (see Table 2-1).

     2.7       The global average surface temperature has increased from the 1860s to the                                       WGI TAR SPM & WGI

                 It is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, of the
                 instrumental record. Extending the instrumental record with proxy data for the Northern
                 Hemisphere indicates that over the past 1,000 years the 20th century increase in temperature
                 is likely to have been the largest of any century, and the 1990s was likely the warmest decade
                 (see Figure 2-3). Insufficient data are available in the Southern Hemisphere prior to the
                 year 1860 to compare the recent warming with changes over the last 1,000 years. Since the
                 year 1950, the increase in sea surface temperature is about half that of the mean land
                 surface air temperature. During this period the nighttime daily minimum temperatures over
                 land have increased on average by about 0.2°C per decade, about twice the corresponding

     human activity is linked to each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions of these forcings, some of which yield warming
     and some cooling. Forcing due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting only for a few years, is not shown. The
     indirect effect of aerosols shown is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect effect of aerosols on clouds, namely
     their effect on cloud lifetime, which would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on greenhouse gases are included in
     the individual bars. The vertical line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the spread in the published values of
     the forcings and physical understanding. Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than others. A vertical line without
     a rectangular bar denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall level of scientific understanding
     for each forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the globe, such as CO2, thereby
     perturbing the global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial distribution, such
     as aerosols. Radiative forcing continues to be a useful tool to estimate, to a first order, the relative climate impacts such as the relative global
     mean surface temperature response due to radiatively induced perturbations, but these global mean forcing estimates are not necessarily
     indicators of the detailed aspects of the potential climate responses (e.g., regional climate change).

surface temperature data, and also in adjustments for urbanization over the land. The lower panel merges proxy data (year-by-year blue line

Insufficient data are available to assess such changes in the Southern Hemisphere.

                  the 1950s to the year 2000, about 0.1°C per decade, has been similar to that
                  at the surface. For the period 1979–2000 both satellite and weather balloon measurements
                  show nearly identical warming over North America (0.3oC per decade) and Europe (0.4oC
                  per decade) for both surface and lower atmosphere, but distinct differences over some land
                  areas and particularly in the tropical regions (0.10±0.10°C per decade for surface versus
                  0.06±0.16°C per decade for the lower atmosphere). Temperatures of the surface and lower
                  atmosphere are influenced differently by factors such as stratospheric ozone depletion,
                  atmospheric aerosols, and the El Niño phenomenon. In addition, spatial sampling techniques
                  can also explain some of the differences in trends, but these differences are not fully resolved.

     (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic
     forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulfate aerosols. Those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural and anthropogenic

     the observed temperature changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic
     factors are included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility
     that other forcings may also have contributed. Similar results to those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing.

2.9    There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming
       observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.

2.10   The observed warming over the 20th century is unlikely to be entirely natural                                 WGI TAR SPM & WGI
       in origin. The increase in surface temperatures over the last 100 years is very unlikely to                   TAR Chapter 12

       be due to internal variability alone. Reconstructions of climate data for the last 1,000 years
       also indicate that this 20th century warming was unusual and unlikely to be the response to
       natural forcing alone: That is, volcanic eruptions and variation in solar irradiance do not
       explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see Figure 2-4a), but they may
       have contributed to the observed warming in the first half.

2.11   In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties,                             WGI TAR SPM & WGI
                                                                                                                     TAR Chapter 12
       most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due
       to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Detection and attribution studies
       (including greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols as anthropogenic forcing) consistently
       find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the last 35 to 50 years, despite
       uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and natural factors (volcanoes
       and solar irradiance). The sulfate and natural forcings are negative over this period and
       cannot explain the warming (see Figure 2-4a); whereas most of these studies find that, over
       the last 50 years, the estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing greenhouse
       gases alone are comparable with, or larger than, the observed warming (Figure 2-4b). The
       best agreement for the 1860–2000 record is found when the above anthropogenic and
       natural forcing factors are combined (see Figure 2-4c). This result does not exclude the
       possibility that other forcings may also contribute, and some known anthropogenic factors
       (e.g., organic carbon, black carbon (soot), biomass aerosols, and some changes in land
       use) have not been used in these detection and attribution studies. Estimates of the magnitude
       and geographic distribution of these additional anthropogenic forcings vary considerably.

2.12   Changes in sea level, snow cover, ice extent, and precipitation                                               WGI TAR SPM & WGII
                                                                                                                     TAR Section 4.3.11
       are consistent with a warming climate near the Earth’s surface
       (see Table 2-1). Some of these changes are regional and some may be due to internal
       climate variations, natural forcings, or regional human activities rather than attributed solely
       to global human influence.

2.13   It is very likely that the 20th century warming has contributed significantly to                              WGI TAR Sections
       the observed rise in global average sea level and increase in ocean-heat                                      2.2.2.5, 11.2, & 11.3.2

       content. Warming drives sea-level rise through thermal expansion of seawater and
       widespread loss of land ice. Based on tide gauge records, after correcting for land
       movements, the average annual rise was between 1 and 2 mm during the 20th century. The
       very few long records show that it was less during the 19th century (see Figure 2-5). Within
       present uncertainties, observations and models are both consistent with a lack of significant
       acceleration of sea-level rise during the 20th century. The observed rate of sea-level rise
       during the 20th century is consistent with models. Global ocean-heat content has increased
       since the late 1950s, the period with adequate observations of subsurface ocean temperatures.

2.14   Snow cover and ice extent have decreased. It is very likely that the extent of snow                           WGI TAR Section 2.2.5
       cover has decreased by about 10% on average in the Northern Hemisphere since the late
       1960s (mainly through springtime changes over America and Eurasia) and that the annual
       duration of lake- and river-ice cover in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern
       Hemisphere has been reduced by about 2 weeks over the 20th century. There has also been
       a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers in non-polar regions during the 20th century. It is
       likely that Northern Hemisphere spring and summer sea-ice extent has decreased by about
       10 to 15% from the 1950s to the year 2000 and that Arctic sea-ice thickness has declined
       by about 40% during late summer and early autumn in the last 3 decades of the 20th
       century. While there is no change in overall Antarctic sea-ice extent from 1978 to 2000 in

             parallel with global mean surface temperature increase, regional warming in the Antarctic
             Peninsula coincided with the collapse of the Prince Gustav and parts of the Larsen ice
             shelves during the 1990s, but the loss of these ice shelves has had little direct impact.

     2.15    Precipitation has very likely increased during the 20th century by 5 to 10%                                    WGI TAR Sections 2.5,
                                                                                                                            2.7.2.2, & 2.7.3
             over most mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere continents,
             but in contrast, rainfall has likely decreased by 3% on average over much of the subtropical
             land areas (see Figure 2-6a). Increasing global mean surface temperature is very likely to
             lead to changes in precipitation and atmospheric moisture because of changes in atmospheric
             circulation, a more active hydrologic cycle, and increases in the water-holding capacity
             throughout the atmosphere. There has likely been a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of
             heavy precipitation events in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere over
             the latter half of the 20th century. There were relatively small long-term increases over the
             20th century in land areas experiencing severe drought or severe wetness, but in many
             regions these changes are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal climate variability
             with no significant trends evident over the 20th century.

     2.16    Changes have also occurred in other important aspects of
             climate (see Table 2-1).

        mid- and high latitudes of northern continents. The warming of land surface faster
        than ocean surface from the years 1976 to 2000 (see Figure 2-6b) is consistent both with the
        observed changes in natural climate variations, such as the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations,
        and with the modeled pattern of greenhouse gas warming. As described below, statistically
        significant associations between regional warming and observed changes in biological systems
        have been documented in freshwater, terrestrial, and marine environments on all continents.

2.18    Warm episodes of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon have                                             WGI TAR Section 2.6.2
        been more frequent, persistent, and intense since the mid-1970s, compared
        with the previous 100 years. ENSO consistently affects regional variations of precipitation
        and temperature over much of the tropics, subtropics, and some mid-latitude areas. It is not
        obvious from models, however, that a warmer world would have a greater frequency of
        occurrence of El Niño events.

2.19    Some important aspects of climate appear not to have changed. A few areas of                                         WGI TAR Sections 2.2.2,

and are only available over the 20th century for some continental regions. Over this period, there were relatively small long-term trends in land

       has lengthened by about 11 days from the years 1959 to 1993, and energy consumption for
       heating in winter has decreased.

       bleaching episodes when sea surface temperatures rise by 1°C in any one season, and
       extensive mortality occurs for a 3°C rise. This typically occurs during El Niño events and
       is exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures. These bleaching events are often associated
       with other stresses such as pollution.

       floods in some areas is related to variations in climate—for example, droughts in Sahel and
       in northeast and southern Brazil, and floods in Colombia and northwest Peru.

2.25   There are preliminary indications that some human systems
       have been affected by recent increases in floods and droughts.
       The rising socio-economic costs related to weather damage and
       to regional variations in climate suggest increasing vulnerability
       to climate change (see Table 2-1).

2.26   Extreme weather or climatic events cause substantial, and increasing, damage.                            WGII TAR SPM & WGII

       Extreme events are currently a major source of climate-related impacts. For example, heavy
       losses of human life, property damage, and other environmental damages were recorded
       during the El Niño event of the years 1997–1998. The impacts of climatic extremes and
       variability are a major concern. Preliminary indications suggest that some social and
       economic systems have been affected by recent increases in floods and droughts, with
       increases in economic losses for catastrophic weather events. Because these systems are
       also affected by changes in socio-economic factors such as demographic shifts and land-
       use changes, quantifying the relative impacts of climate change (either anthropogenic or
       natural) and of socio-economic factors is difficult. For example, direct costs of global
       catastrophic weather-related losses, corrected for inflation, have risen an order of magnitude
       from the 1950s to the 1990s (see Figure 2-7), and costs for non-catastrophic weather events
       have grown similarly. The number of weather-related catastrophic events has risen three
       times faster than the number of non-weather-related events, despite generally enhanced
       disaster preparedness. Part of this observed upward trend in weather-related losses over
       the past 50 years is linked to socio-economic factors (e.g., population growth, increased
       wealth, urbanization in vulnerable areas), and part is linked to regional climatic factors
       (e.g., changes in precipitation, flooding events).

             equity. Insurers pay only 5% of total economic losses today in Asia and South America,
             10% in Africa, and about 30% in Australia, Europe, and North and Central America. The
             fraction covered is typically much higher when just storm losses are considered, but flood-
             and crop-related losses have much lower coverage. The balance of the losses are absorbed
             by governments and affected individuals and organizations.

     3.1    The greenhouse gas emissions scenarios used as the basis for the climate projections in the
            TAR are those contained in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (see Box 3-1).
            Because the SRES scenarios had only been available for a very short time prior to production
            of the TAR, it was not possible to include impact assessments based on these scenarios.
            Hence, the impacts assessments in the TAR use climate model results that tend to be based on
            equilibrium climate change scenarios (e.g., 2xCO2), a relatively small number of experiments
            using a 1% per year CO2 increase transient scenario, or the scenarios used in the Second
            Assessment Report (i.e., the IS92 series). The challenge in answering this question therefore
            is to try and map these impact results onto the climate change results, which have used the
            SRES scenarios. This, by necessity, requires various approximations to be made and in
            many cases only qualitative conclusions can be drawn. Projections of changes in climate
            variability, extreme events, and abrupt/non-linear changes are covered in Question 4.


      Box 3-1   Future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities will alter the                    WGI TAR Chapters 3, 4, 5,
                atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate.                                                 &6
      Changes in climate occur as a result of internal variability of the climate system and external factors
      (both natural and as a result of human activities). Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to
      human activities change the composition of the atmosphere. Future emissions of greenhouse gases and
      aerosols are determined by driving forces such as population, socio-economic development, and
      technological change, and hence are highly uncertain. Scenarios are alternative images of how the future
      might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to analyze how driving forces may influence future
      emission outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties. The SRES scenarios, developed to update
      the IS92 series, consist of six scenario groups, based on narrative storylines, which span a wide range of
      these driving forces (see Figure 3-1). They are all plausible and internally consistent, and no
      probabilities of occurrence are assigned. They encompass four combinations of demographic change,
      social and economic development, and broad technological developments (A1B, A2, B1, B2). Two
      further scenario groups, A1FI and A1T, explicitly explore alternative energy technology developments
      to A1B (see Figure 3-1a). The resulting emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O, along
      with SO2 which leads to the production of sulfate aerosols, are shown in Figures 3-1b to 3-1e; other
      gases and particles are also important. These emissions cause changes in the concentrations of these
      gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. The changes in the concentrations for the SRES scenarios are
      shown in Figures 3-1f to 3-1i. Note that for gases which stay in the atmosphere for a long period, such
      as CO2 shown in panel (f), the atmospheric concentration responds to changes in emissions relatively
      slowly (e.g., see Figure 5-3); whereas for short-lived gases and aerosols, such as sulfate aerosols shown
      in panel (i), the atmospheric concentration responds much more quickly. The influence of changes in the
      concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere on the climate system can broadly be
      compared using the concept of radiative forcing, which is a measure of the influence a factor has in
      altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system. A positive
      radiative forcing, such as that produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, tends to
      warm the surface; conversely a negative radiative forcing, which can arise from an increase in some
      types of aerosols such as sulfate aerosols, tends to cool the surface. The radiative forcing resulting from
      the increasing concentrations in panels (f) to (i) is shown in panel (j). Note that, as with the IS92
      scenarios, all combinations of emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the SRES scenarios result
      in increased radiative forcing.



     3.2    Carbon dioxide concentrations, globally averaged surface
            temperature, and sea level are projected to increase under all
            IPCC emissions scenarios during the 21st century.

     3.3    All SRES emissions scenarios result in an increase in the atmospheric                                           WGI TAR Section 3.7.3.3
            concentration of CO2. For the six illustrative SRES scenarios, the projected concentrations
            of CO2—the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas—in the year 2100 range from 540 to
            970 ppm, compared to about 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era and about 368 ppm in the
            year 2000 (see Figure 3-1f). These projections include the land and ocean climate feedbacks.
            The different socio-economic assumptions (demographic, social, economic, and technological)
            result in different levels of future greenhouse gases and aerosols. Further uncertainties,
            especially regarding the persistence of the present removal processes (carbon sinks) and
            the magnitude of the climate feedback on the terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of
            about −10 to +30% in the year 2100 concentration, around each scenario. The total range
            is 490 to 1,260 ppm (75 to 350% above the year 1750 (pre-industrial) concentration).

           gases by year 2100 vary considerably across the six illustrative SRES scenarios.
           For most cases, A1B, A1T, and B1 have the smallest increases, and A1FI and A2 the largest
           (see Figures 3-1g and 3-1h).

3.5        The SRES scenarios include the possibility of either increases or decreases                                          WGI TAR Section 5.5 &

           policies to abate polluting emissions. As seen in Figure 3-1i, sulfate aerosol
           concentrations are projected to fall below present levels by 2100 in all six illustrative
           SRES scenarios. This would result in warming relative to present day. In addition, natural
           aerosols (e.g., sea salt, dust, and emissions leading to sulfate and carbon aerosols) are
           projected to increase as a result of changes in climate.

3.6        The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to                                         WGI TAR Section 9.3.3
           5.8°C over the period 1990 to 2100 (see Figure 3-1k). This is about two to ten
           times larger than the central value of observed warming over the 20th century
           and the projected rate of warming is very likely to be without precedent during
           at least the last 10,000 years, based on paleoclimate data (see Figure 9-1). For
           the periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected increases are 0.4 to 1.1°C and
           0.8 to 2.6°C, respectively. These results are for the full range of 35 SRES scenarios, based
           on a number of climate models.4 Temperature increases are projected to be greater than
           those in the SAR, which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on six IS92 scenarios. The higher
           projected temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to lower projected SO2
           emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to the IS92 scenarios, because of structural changes
           in the energy system as well as concerns about local and regional air pollution.

           models for the same emissions scenario is comparable to the range across
           different SRES emissions scenarios for a single climate model. Figure 3-1
           shows that the SRES scenarios with the highest emissions result in the largest projected
           temperature increases. Further uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in the radiative forcing.
           The largest forcing uncertainty is that due to the sulfate aerosols.

and sea level, which in turn will cause impacts. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives
and no probabilities of occurrence are assigned. Because the SRES scenarios had only been available for a very short time prior to production
of the TAR, the impacts assessments here use climate model results which tend to be based on equilibrium climate change scenarios (e.g.,
2xCO2), a relatively small number of experiments using a 1% per year CO2 increase transient scenario, or the scenarios used in the Second
Assessment Report (i.e., the IS92 series). Impacts in turn can affect socio-economic development paths through, for example, adaptation and
mitigation. The highlighted boxes along the top of the figure illustrate how the various aspects relate to the integrated assessment framework
for considering climate change (see Figure 1-1).

    Complex physically based climate models are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to
    explore the range of scenarios, these are complemented by simple climate models calibrated to yield an equivalent
    response in temperature and sea level to complex climate models. These projections are obtained using a simple
    climate model whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of seven complex climate
    models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 4.2°C, which is comparable to the
    commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. For the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM)
    experiments for the end of the 21st century (years 2071 to 2100) compared with the period 1961 to 1990, the
    mean warming for SRES scenario A2 is 3.0°C with a range of 1.3 to 4.5°C, while for SRES scenario B2 the mean
    warming is 2.2°C with a range of 0.9 to 3.4°C.

     3.8     Globally averaged annual precipitation is projected to increase during the                                      WGI TAR Section 9.3.1
             21st century. Globally averaged water vapor and evaporation are also projected to increase.

     3.9     Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m between the years                                  WGI TAR Section 11.5.1
             1990 and 2100, for the full range of SRES scenarios (see Figure 3-1l). For the
             periods 1990 to 2025 and 1990 to 2050, the projected rises are 0.03 to 0.14 m and 0.05 to
             0.32 m, respectively. This is due primarily to thermal expansion and loss of mass from
             glaciers and ice caps. The range of sea-level rise presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m,
             based on the IS92 scenarios. Despite the higher temperature change projections in this
             assessment, the sea-level projections are slightly lower, primarily due to the use of improved
             models, which give a smaller contribution from glaciers and ice sheets.

     3.10    Substantial differences are projected in regional changes in
             climate and sea level, compared to the global mean change.

     3.11    It is very likely that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than the                                    WGI TAR Section 10.3.2
             global average, particularly those at northern high latitudes in winter. Most
             notable of these is the warming in the northern regions of North America, and northern and
             central Asia, which exceeds global mean warming in each model by more than 40%. In
             contrast, the warming is less than the global mean change in south and southeast Asia in
             summer and in southern South America in winter (see Figure 3-2).

     3.12    At the regional scale, both increases and decreases in precipitation are                                        WGI TAR Section 10.3.2
             projected, typically of 5 to 20%. It is likely that precipitation will increase over high
             latitude regions in both summer and winter. Increases are also projected over northern
             mid-latitudes, tropical Africa and Antarctica in winter, and in southern and eastern Asia in
             summer. Australia, Central America, and southern Africa show consistent decreases in
             winter rainfall. Larger year-to-year variations in precipitation are very likely over most
             areas where an increase in mean precipitation is projected (see Figure 3-3).

     3.13    The projected range of regional variation in sea-level change is substantial                                    WGI TAR Section 11.5.2
             compared to projected global average sea-level rise, because the level of the
             sea at the shoreline is determined by many factors (see Figure 3-4). Confidence
             in the regional distribution of sea-level change from complex models is low because there
             is little similarity between model results, although nearly all models project greater than
             average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average rise in the Southern Ocean.

     3.14    Glaciers and ice caps are projected to continue their widespread retreat during                                WGI TAR Section 11.5.4
             the 21st century. Northern Hemisphere snow cover, permafrost, and sea-ice extent are
             projected to decrease further. The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass because of
             greater precipitation, while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass because the increase
             in runoff will exceed the precipitation increase. Concerns that have been expressed about
             the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet are covered in Question 4.


     Figure 3-2: The background shows the annual mean change of temperature (color shading) for (a) the                     WGI TAR Figures 9.10d &
     SRES scenario A2 and (b) the SRES scenario B2. Both SRES scenarios show the period 2071 to 2100                        9.10e, & WGI TAR Box 10.1
     relative to the period 1961 to 1990, and were performed by AOGCMs. Scenarios A2 and B2 are shown as no                 (Figure 1)

     AOGCM runs were available for the other SRES scenarios. The boxes show an analysis of inter-model consistency in regional relative warming
     (i.e., warming relative to each model’s global average warming) for the same scenarios. Regions are classified as showing either agreement on
     warming in excess of 40% above the global mean annual average (much greater than average warming), agreement on warming greater than
     the global mean annual average (greater than average warming), agreement on warming less than the global mean annual average (less than
     average warming), or disagreement amongst models on the magnitude of regional relative warming (inconsistent magnitude of warming).
     There is also a category for agreement on cooling (this category never occurs). A consistent result from at least seven of the nine models is
     defined as being necessary for agreement. The global mean annual average warming of the models used span 1.2 to 4.5°C for A2 and 0.9 to
     3.4°C for B2, and therefore a regional 40% amplification represents warming ranges of 1.7 to 6.3°C for A2 and 1.3 to 4.7°C for B2.

3.15    Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse
        environmental and socio-economic effects, but the larger the
        changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse
        effects predominate.

3.16    The impacts of climate change will be more severe the greater the cumulative                                     WGII TAR Sections 1.2,
                                                                                                                         19.3, 19.5, & 19.8
        emissions of greenhouse gases (medium confidence). Climate change can have
        beneficial as well as adverse effects, but adverse effects are projected to predominate for much
        of the world. The various effects of climate change pose risks that increase with global mean
        temperature. Many of these risks have been organized into five reasons for concern: threats
        to endangered species and unique systems, damages from extreme climate events, effects
        that fall most heavily on developing countries and the poor within countries, global aggregate
        impacts, and large-scale high-impact events (see Box 3-2 and Figure 3-1). The effects of
        climate change on human health, ecosystems, food production, water resources, small islands
        and low-lying coastal regions, and aggregate market activities are summarized below. However,
        note that future changes in the frequency or intensity of extreme events have not been taken
        into account in most of these studies (see also Question 4).

that operate on a great range of time scales, from hours (tidal) to millions of years (ocean basin changes
due to tectonics and sedimentation). On the time scale of decades to centuries, some of the largest influences on the average levels of the
sea are linked to climate and climate change processes.

         Box 3-2    Concerns about the risks from climate change rise with temperature.
           • Unique and threatened systems: Some changes in species and systems have already been associated                        WGII TAR Sections 5.2,
             with observed changes in climate, and some highly vulnerable species and systems may be at risk of                     5.4, & 19.3
             damage or even loss for very small changes in climate. Greater warming would intensify the risks
             to these species and systems, and place additional ones at risk.
           • Extreme climate events: Increased frequencies and intensities of some extreme events have already                      WGII TAR Sections 15.2 &
             been observed (see Question 2) and are likely to increase with further warming, as would the risks                     19.6
             to human life, property, crops, livestock, and ecosystems. These risks increase where development
             is occurring in inherently dynamic and unstable zones (e.g., river floodplains and low-lying coastal
             regions) (see also Question 4).
           • Uneven distribution of impacts: In general, developing countries are at greater risk of adverse                        WGII TAR Section 19.4
             impacts from climate change than are developed countries, of which some of the latter may
             experience market sector benefits for warming less than a few °C. For greater warming, most
             regions are at risk of predominantly negative effects from climate change. But developing
             countries generally would continue to be more severely impacted than developed countries. Within
             countries, vulnerability varies and the poorest populations often have higher exposure to impacts
             that threaten their lives and livelihoods.
           • Global aggregate impacts: Globally aggregated market sector impacts may be positive or negative                        WGII TAR Section 19.5
             up to a few °C, though the majority of people may be negatively affected. With greater warming,
             the risk of negative global market sector impacts increases, and impacts would be predominantly
             negative for most people.
           • Large-scale, high-impact events: The probability of large-scale, high-impact events within a 100-                      WGII TAR Section 19.6
             year time horizon such as shutdown of the thermohaline circulation or collapse of the West Antarctic
             ice sheet is very low for warming less than a few °C. The risk, which is a product of the probabilities
             of these events and the magnitude of their consequences, is largely unquantified. For greater
             warming, and over a time horizon longer than 100 years, the probabilities and the risks increase,
             but by an amount that cannot now be estimated. See also Question 4.



                Human Health

     3.17       Overall climate change is projected to increase threats to human health,                                            WGII TAR Sections 5.3,
                                                                                                                                    9.1, 9.5, & 9.11
                particularly in lower income populations predominantly within tropical/
                subtropical countries. Climate change can affect human health through multiple pathways,
                including direct effects (e.g., reduced cold stress in temperate countries but increased heat
                stress, loss of life in floods and storms) and indirect effects that operate through changes in
                the ranges of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes)5, water-borne pathogens, water quality, air
                quality, food availability and quality (e.g., decreased protein content in some cereals), population
                displacement, and economic disruption (medium to high confidence). Some effects may be
                beneficial (e.g., reduced cold stress, and reduced disease transmission in some cases), but
                the predominant effect is anticipated to be adverse (see Table 3-1). Actual impacts will be
                strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and socio-economic circumstances, and
                for each anticipated adverse health impact there is a range of social, institutional, technological,
                and behavioral adaptation options to lessen that impact. Adaptations could, for example,
                encompass strengthening of the public health infrastructure, health-oriented management
                of the environment (including air and water quality, food safety, urban and housing design,
                and surface water management), and the provision of appropriate medical care.

     3.18       Diversity in ecological systems is expected to be affected by climate change                                        WGII TAR Sections 5.2.3,

                species (high confidence). Significant disruptions of ecosystems from disturbances
                such as fire, drought, pest infestation, invasion of species, storms, and coral bleaching
                events are expected to increase (see Table 3-2). The stresses caused by climate change,
                added to other stresses on ecological systems (e.g., land conversion, land degradation,
                harvesting, and pollution), threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique
                ecosystems, and extinction of some critically endangered and endangered species. Coral

 a   The reported ranges for CO2 concentration are estimated with fast carbon cycle models for the six illustrative SRES scenarios and
     correspond to the minimum and maximum values estimated with a fast carbon cycle model for the 35 SRES projections of
     greenhouse gas emissions. See WGI TAR Section 3.7.3.
 b   The reported ranges for global mean temperature change and global mean sea-level rise correspond to the minimum and maximum
     values estimated with a simple climate model for the 35 SRES projections of greenhouse gas and SO2 emissions. See WGI TAR
     Sections 9.3.3 and 11.5.1.
 c   Summary statements about effects of climate change in the years 2025, 2050, and 2100 are inferred from Working Group II’s
     assessment of studies that investigate the impacts of scenarios other than the SRES projections, as studies that use the SRES
     projections have not been published yet. Estimates of the impacts of climate change vary by region and are highly sensitive to
     estimates of regional and seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation changes, changes in the frequencies or intensities of
     climate extremes, and rates of change. Estimates of impacts are also highly sensitive to assumptions about characteristics of future
     societies and the extent and effectiveness of future adaptations to climate change. In consequence, summary statements about the
     impacts of climate change in the years 2025, 2050, and 2100 must necessarily be general and qualitative. The statements in the table
     are considered to be valid for a broad range of scenarios. Note, however, that few studies have investigated the effects of climate
     changes that would accompany global temperature increases near the upper end of the range reported for the year 2100.
 d   Judgments of confidence use the following scale: very high (95% or greater), high (67–95%), medium (33–67%), low (5–33%), and
     very low (5% or less). See WGII TAR Box 1-1.


         reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie
         wetlands, and remnant native grasslands are examples of systems threatened by climate
         change. In some cases the threatened ecosystems are those that could mitigate against
         some climate change impacts (e.g., coastal systems that buffer the impacts of storms).
         Possible adaptation methods to reduce the loss of biodiversity include the establishment of
         refuges, parks and reserves with corridors to allow migration of species, and the use of
         captive breeding and translocation of species.

3.19     The productivity of ecological systems is highly sensitive to climate change                                 WGI TAR Section 3.7 &

         (medium confidence). Increasing CO2 concentrations would increase net primary
         productivity (CO2 fertilization) and net ecosystem productivity in most vegetation systems,
         causing carbon to accumulate in vegetation and soils over time. Climate change may either
         augment or reduce the direct effects of CO2 on productivity, depending on the type of
         vegetation, the region, and the scenario of climate change.

      e   Aggregate market effects represent the net effects of estimated economic gains and losses summed across market sectors such as
          agriculture, commercial forestry, energy, water, and construction. The estimates generally exclude the effects of changes in climate
          variability and extremes, do not account for the effects of different rates of change, and only partially account for impacts on goods
          and services that are not traded in markets. These omissions are likely to result in underestimates of economic losses and
          overestimates of economic gains. Estimates of aggregate impacts are controversial because they treat gains for some as canceling out
          losses for others and because the weights that are used to aggregate across individuals are necessarily subjective.

              result of delays between enhanced plant growth and plant death and decay. Current enhanced
              plant growth is partly due to fertilization effects of elevated CO2 on plant photosynthesis
              (either directly via increased carbon assimilation, or indirectly through higher water-use
              efficiency), nitrogen deposition (especially in the Northern Hemisphere), climate change,
              and land-use practices over past decades. The uptake will decline as forests reach maturity,
              fertilization effects saturate and decomposition catches up with growth, and possibly through
              changes in disturbance regimes (e.g., fire and insect outbreaks) mediated through climate
              change. Some global models project that the net uptake of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems

3.21     Models of cereal crops indicate that in some temperate areas potential yields                                 WGII TAR Sections 5.3.4-6,
                                                                                                                       & 9.9
         increase for small increases in temperature but decrease with larger temperature
         changes (medium to low confidence). In most tropical and subtropical regions
         potential yields are projected to decrease for most projected increases in
         temperature (medium confidence) (see Table 3-3). In mid-latitudes, crop models
         indicate that warming of less than a few °C and the associated increase in CO2 concentrations
         will lead to generally positive responses and generally negative responses with greater
         warming. In tropical agricultural areas, similar assessments indicate that yields of some
         crops would decrease with even minimal increases in temperature because they are near
         their maximum temperature tolerance. Where there is also a large decrease in rainfall in
         subtropical and tropical dryland/rainfed systems, crop yields would be even more adversely
         affected. Assessments that include autonomous agronomic adaptation (e.g., changes in
         planting times and crop varieties) tend to project yields less adversely affected by climate
         change than without adaptation. These assessments include the effects of CO2 fertilization
         but not technological innovations or changes in the impacts of pests and diseases, degradation
         of soil and water resources, or climate extremes. The ability of livestock producers to
         adapt their herds to the physiological stresses associated with climate change is poorly
         known. Warming of a few °C or more is projected to increase food prices globally, and may

            Demand for water is generally increasing due to population growth and economic development,
            but is falling in some countries because of increased efficiency of use. Climate change is
            projected to reduce streamflow and groundwater recharge in many parts of the world but to
            increase it in some other areas (medium confidence). The amount of change varies among
            scenarios partly because of differences in projected rainfall (especially rainfall intensity)
            and partly because of differences in projected evaporation. Projected streamflow changes
            under two climate change scenarios are shown in Figure 3-5. Several hundred million to a
            few billion people are projected to suffer a supply reduction of 10% or more by the year
            2050 for climate change projections corresponding to 1% per year increase in CO2 emissions
            (see Table 3-4). Freshwater quality generally would be degraded by higher water
            temperatures (high confidence), but this may be offset by increased flows in some regions.
            The effects of climate changes on water scarcity, water quality, and the frequency and
            intensity of floods and droughts will intensify challenges for water and flood management.
            Unmanaged and poorly managed water systems are the most vulnerable to adverse effects
            of climate change.

for the period 1961–1990, largely follow projected changes in precipitation. Changes in runoff are calculated
with a hydrologic model using as inputs climate projections from two versions of the Hadley Centre AOGCM for a scenario of 1% per year increase
in effective CO2 concentration in the atmosphere: (a) HadCM2 ensemble mean and (b) HadCM3. Projected increases in runoff in high latitudes
and southeast Asia, and decreases in central Asia, the area around the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and Australia are broadly consistent
across the Hadley Centre experiments, and with the precipitation projections of other AOGCM experiments. For other areas of the world,
changes in precipitation and runoff are scenario- and model-dependent.

            increase in populations at risk are southern Asia and southeast Asia, with lesser but significant
            increases in eastern Africa, western Africa, and the Mediterranean from Turkey to Algeria.
            Significant portions of many highly populated coastal cities are also vulnerable to permanent
            land submergence and especially to more frequent coastal flooding superimposed on surge
            heights, due to sea-level rise. These estimates assume no change in the frequency or intensity of
            storms, which could exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on flooding risks in some areas.

            all magnitudes of global mean temperature increases studied (low confidence),
            and are estimated to be mixed for developed countries for up to a few °C warming
            (low confidence) and negative for warming beyond a few °C (medium to low
            confidence). The effects of climate change will have market sector effects by changing
            the abundance, quality, and prices of food, fiber, water, and other goods and services (see
            Table 3-5). In addition, climate change can have market effects through changes in energy
            demand, hydropower supply, transportation, tourism and construction, damages to property
            and insurance losses from extreme climate events, loss of coastal land from sea-level rise,
            location and relocation decisions for development and populations, and the resource needs
            and costs of adapting to climate change. Estimates of net market effects from a few published
            studies, aggregated across sectors and to national or regional scales, indicate losses for most
            developing countries and regions studied. Both gains and losses are estimated for developed

 Synthesis Report                                                                                         Question 3




       countries and regions for increases in global mean temperature of up to a few °C. Economic
       losses are estimated for developed countries at larger temperature increases. When aggregated
       to a global scale, world GDP would change by plus or minus a few percent for global mean
       temperature increases of up to a few °C, with increasing net losses for larger increases in
       temperature. The estimates generally exclude the effects of changes in climate variability
       and extremes, do not account for the effects of different rates of climate change, only
       partially account for impacts on goods and services that are not traded in markets, and treat
       gains for some as canceling out losses for others. Therefore, confidence in estimates of
       market effects for individual countries is generally low, and the various omissions are likely
       to result in underestimates of economic losses and overestimates of economic gains.

3.26   Adaptation has the potential to reduce adverse effects of climate
       change and can often produce immediate ancillary benefits, but
       will not prevent all damages.

3.27   Numerous possible adaptation options for responding to climate change have                                 WGII TAR Sections 18.2.3
                                                                                                                  & 18.3.5
       been identified that can reduce adverse and enhance beneficial impacts of
       climate change, but will incur costs. Quantitative evaluation of their benefits and
       costs and how they vary across regions and entities is incomplete. Adaptation to climate
       change can take many forms, including actions taken by people with the intent of lessening
       impacts or utilizing new opportunities, and structural and functional changes in natural
       systems made in response to changes in pressures. The focus in this report is on the adaptive
       actions of people. The range of options includes reactive adaptations (actions taken
       concurrent with changed conditions and without prior preparation) and planned adaptations
       (actions taken either concurrent with or in anticipation of changed conditions, but with
       prior preparation). Adaptations can be taken by private entities (e.g., individuals, households,
       or business firms) or by public entities (e.g., local, state, or national government agencies).
       Examples of identified options are listed in Table 3-6. The benefits and costs of adaptation
       options, evaluation of which is incomplete, will also vary across regions and entities. Despite
       the incomplete and evolving state of knowledge about adaptation, a number of robust
       findings have been derived and summarized.

3.28   Greater and more rapid climate change would pose greater challenges for                                    WGII TAR Sections 18.2.2,
                                                                                                                  18.3.3, & 18.3.5
       adaptation and greater risks of damages than would lesser and slower change.
       Key features of climate change to be adapted to include the magnitudes and rates of changes
       in climate extremes, variability, and mean conditions. Natural and human systems have
       evolved capabilities to cope with a range of climate variability within which the risks of
       damage are relatively low and ability to recover is high. Changes in climate that result in
       increased frequency of events that fall outside the historic range with which systems have
       coped, however, increase the risk of severe damages and incomplete recovery or collapse
       of the system. Changes in mean conditions (e.g., increases in average temperature), even in
       the absence of changes in variance, can lead to increases in the frequencies of some events
       (e.g., more frequent heat waves) that exceed the coping range, and decreases in the
       frequencies of others (e.g., less frequent cold spells) (see Question 4 and Figure 4-1).

3.29   Enhancement of adaptive capacity can extend or shift ranges for coping with                                WGII TAR Sections 18.2.2
                                                                                                                  & 18.3.5
       variability and extremes to generate benefits in the present and future. Many
       of the adaptation options listed in Table 3-6 are presently employed to cope with current
       climate variability and extremes, and their expanded use can enhance both current and
       future capacity to cope. But such efforts may not be as effective in the future as the amount
       and rate of climate change increase.

3.30   The potential direct benefits of adaptation are substantial and take the form                              WGII TAR Sections 5.3.4,

            substantially reduce many of the adverse impacts and enhance beneficial impacts. For
            example, analyses of coastal flood risks from storm surges estimate that climate change-
            driven sea-level rise would increase the average annual number of people flooded many-
            fold if coastal flood protection is unchanged from the present. But if coastal flood protection
            is enhanced in proportion to future GDP growth, the projected increase is cut by as much
            as two-thirds (see Figure 3-6). However, estimates such as these indicate only potential
            benefits from adaptation, not the likely benefits—as analyses generally use arbitrary
            assumptions about adaptation options and obstacles, often omit consideration of changes
            in climate extremes and variability, and do not account for imperfect foresight.

     3.31   Estimates of the costs of adaptation are few; the available estimates indicate                                 WGII TAR Sections 6.5.2 &

        of “hard structures” such as dikes, levees, and seawalls, and the use of “soft structures”
        such as nourishment of beaches with sand and dune restoration. Estimates of the costs of
        protecting coasts vary depending on assumptions about what decisions will be made
        regarding the extent of the coastline to be protected, the types of structures to be used, the
        timing of their implementation (which is influenced by the rate of sea-level rise), and discount
        rates. Different assumptions about these factors yield estimates for protection of U.S. coasts
        from 0.5-m sea-level rise by the year 2100 that range from US$20 billion to US$150
        billion in present value.

3.32    Climate change is expected to negatively impact development,
        sustainability, and equity.

3.33    The impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately upon developing                                  WGII TAR Sections 18.5.1-3
        countries and the poor persons within all countries, and thereby exacerbate
        inequities in health status and access to adequate food, clean water, and
        other resources. As already noted, populations in developing countries are generally
        expected to be exposed to relatively high risks of adverse impacts from climate change on
        human health, water supplies, agricultural productivity, property, and other resources.
        Poverty, lack of training and education, lack of infrastructure, lack of access to technologies,
        lack of diversity in income opportunities, degraded natural resource base, misplaced
        incentives, inadequate legal framework, and struggling public and private institutions create
        conditions of low adaptive capacity in most developing countries. The exposures and low
        capacity to adapt combine to make populations in developing countries generally more
        vulnerable than populations in developed countries.

3.34    Non-sustainable resource use adds to the vulnerability to climate change.                                   WGII TAR Sections 1.2.2,
                                                                                                                    4.7, 5.1, 6.3.4, & 6.4.4
        Conversion of natural habitat to human uses, high harvesting rates of resources from the
        environment, cultivation and grazing practices that fail to protect soils from degradation,
        and pollution of air and water can reduce the robustness of systems to cope with variations
        or change in climate, and the resilience of systems to recover from declines. Such pressures

            make systems, and the populations that derive goods, services, and livelihoods from them,
            highly vulnerable to climate change. These pressures are present in developed as well as
            developing countries, but satisfying development goals in ways that do not place non-
            sustainable pressures on systems pose a particular dilemma for developing countries.

     3.35   Hazards associated with climate change can undermine progress toward                                        WGII TAR Section 18.6.1
            sustainable development. More frequent and intensified droughts can exacerbate land
            degradation. Increases in heavy precipitation events can increase flooding, landslides, and
            mudslides, the destruction from which can set back development efforts by years in some
            instances. Advances in health and nutritional status could be set back in some areas by climate
            change impacts on human health and agriculture. Hazards such as these can also be exacerbated
            by further development in inherently dynamic and unstable zones (e.g., floodplains, barrier
            beaches, low-lying coasts, and deforested steep slopes).

     3.36   Climate change can detract from the effectiveness of development projects                                   WGII TAR Section 18.6.1
            if not taken into account. Development projects often involve investments in infrastructure,
            institutions, and human capital for the management of climate-sensitive resources such as
            water, hydropower, agricultural lands, and forests. The performance of these projects can
            be affected by climate change and increased climate variability, yet these factors are given
            little consideration in the design of projects. Analyses have shown that flexibility to perform
            well under a wider range of climate conditions can be built into projects at modest
            incremental costs in some instances, and that greater flexibility has immediate value because
            of risks from present climate variability.

     3.37   Many of the requirements for enhancing capacity to adapt to climate change                                  WGII TAR Section 18.6.1
            are similar to those for promoting sustainable development. Examples of common
            requirements for enhancing adaptive capacity and sustainable development include
            increasing access to resources and lowering inequities in access, reducing poverty, improving
            education and training, investing in infrastructure, involving concerned parties in managing

Question 4

What is known about the influence of the increasing atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the projected
human-induced change in climate regionally and globally on:

a.   The frequency and magnitude of climate fluctuations, including daily,
     seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal variability, such as the El Niño
     Southern Oscillation cycles and others?
b.   The duration, location, frequency, and intensity of extreme events
     such as heat waves, droughts, floods, heavy precipitation, avalanches,
     storms, tornadoes, and tropical cyclones?
c.   The risk of abrupt/non-linear changes in, among others, the sources
     and sinks of greenhouse gases, ocean circulation, and the extent of
     polar ice and permafrost? If so, can the risk be quantified?
d.   The risk of abrupt or non-linear changes in ecological systems?

     4.1    This answer focuses on projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate fluctuations
            as a result of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Particular emphasis
            is placed on changes in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of climatic extremes, which
            represent important climate change risks for ecological systems and socio-economic sectors.
            Projected abrupt or other non-linear changes in the biophysical system are discussed here;
            the gradual changes in the physical, biological, and social systems are discussed in Question 3.

     4.2    Models project that increasing atmospheric concentrations of                                                WGI TAR Sections 9.3.5-6,
                                                                                                                        & WGII TAR Section 14.1.3
            greenhouse gases will result in changes in daily, seasonal, inter-
            annual, and decadal variability. There is projected to be a decrease in diurnal
            temperature range in many areas, with nighttime lows increasing more than daytime highs.
            A number of models show a general decrease of daily variability of surface air temperature
            in winter and increased daily variability in summer in the Northern Hemisphere land areas.
            Current projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude for El Niño events
            over the next 100 years. Many models show a more El Niño-like mean response in the tropical
            Pacific, with the central and eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures projected
            to warm more than the western equatorial Pacific and with a corresponding mean eastward
            shift of precipitation. Even with little or no change in El Niño strength, global warming is
            likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of droughts
            and floods that occur with El Niño events in many different regions. There is no clear agreement
            between models concerning the changes in frequency or structure of other naturally occurring
            atmosphere-ocean circulation pattern such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

     4.3    The duration, location, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather
            and climate events are likely to very likely to change, and would
            result in mostly adverse impacts on biophysical systems.

     4.4    Natural circulation patterns, such as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in global                       WGI TAR Sections 1.2 & 2.7
            climate and its short-term (daily, intra- and inter-annual) and longer term (decadal to multi-
            decadal) variability. Climate change may manifest itself as a shift in means as well as a
            change in preference of specific climate circulation patterns that could result in changes in
            the variance and frequency of extremes of climatic variables (see Figure 4-1).

     4.5    More hot days and heat waves and fewer cold and frost days are very likely                                  WGI TAR Sections 9.3.6 &
                                                                                                                        10.3.2, & WGII TAR Sections
            over nearly all land areas. Increases in mean temperature will lead to increases in hot
                                                                                                                        5.3, 9.4.2, & 19.5
            weather and record hot weather, with fewer frost days and cold waves (see Figure 4-1a,b).
            A number of models show a generally decreased daily variability of surface air temperature
            in winter and increased daily variability in summer in Northern Hemisphere land areas.
            The changes in temperature extremes are likely to result in increased crop and livestock
            losses, higher energy use for cooling and lower for heating, and increased human morbidity
            and heat-stress-related mortality (see Table 4-1). Fewer frost days will result in decreased
            cold-related human morbidity and mortality, and decreased risk of damage to a number of
            crops, though the risk to other crops may increase. Benefits to agriculture from a small
            temperature increase could result in small increases in the GDP of temperate zone countries.

     4.6    The amplitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events is very likely to                               WGI TAR Section 9.3.6 &
                                                                                                                        WGII TAR Sections 4.3.8,
            increase over many areas and the return period for extreme precipitation events are
                                                                                                                        9.5.3, 9.7.10, & 9.8
            projected to decrease. This would lead to more frequent floods and landslides with attendant
            loss of life, health impacts (e.g., epidemics, infectious diseases, food poisoning), property
            damage, loss to infrastructure and settlements, soil erosion, pollution loads, insurance and
            agriculture losses, amongst others. A general drying of the mid-continental areas during
            summer is likely to lead to increases in summer droughts and could increase the risk of
            wild fires. This general drying is due to a combination of increased temperature and potential
            evaporation that is not balanced by increases in precipitation. It is likely that global warming
            will lead to an increase in the variability of Asian summer monsoon precipitation.

        intensity of tropical cyclones is likely to increase by 5 to 10% and precipitation
        rates may increase by 20 to 30%, but none of the studies suggest that the locations of the
        tropical cyclones will change. There is little consistent modeling evidence for changes in

              changes include large climate-induced increase in greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial
              ecosystems, a collapse of the thermohaline circulation (THC; see Figure 4-2), and disintegration
              of the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets. Some of these changes have low probability
              of occurrence during the 21st century; however, greenhouse gas forcing in the 21st century
              could set in motion changes that could lead to such transitions in subsequent centuries (see
              Question 5). Some of these changes (e.g., to THC) could be irreversible over centuries to
              millennia. There is a large degree of uncertainty about the mechanisms involved and about
              the likelihood or time scales of such changes; however, there is evidence from polar ice
              cores of atmospheric regimes changing within a few years and large-scale hemispheric changes

        and other greenhouse gases from plants and soil and changes in surface properties and albedo.

4.12    Large, rapid increases in atmospheric CH4 either from reductions in the                                          WGI TAR Section 4.2.1.1
        atmospheric chemical sink or from release of buried CH4 reservoirs appear
        exceptionally unlikely. The rapid increase in CH4 lifetime possible with large emissions
        of tropospheric pollutants does not occur within the range of SRES scenarios. The CH4
        reservoir buried in solid hydrate deposits under permafrost and ocean sediments is enormous,
        more than 1,000-fold the current atmospheric content. A proposed climate feedback occurs
        when the hydrates decompose in response to warming and release large amounts of CH4;
        however, most of the CH4 gas released from the solid form is decomposed by bacteria in
        the sediments and water column, thus limiting the amount emitted to the atmosphere unless
        explosive ebullient emissions occur. The feedback has not been quantified, but there are no
        observations to support a rapid, massive CH4 release in the record of atmospheric CH4
        over the past 50,000 years.

Figure 4-2: Schematic illustration of the global circulation system in the world ocean consisting of major north-south thermohaline
circulation routes in each ocean basin joining in the Antarctic circumpolar circulation. Warm surface currents and cold deep currents are
connected in the few areas of deepwater formation in the high latitudes of the Atlantic and around Antarctica (blue), where the major ocean-to-
atmosphere heat transfer occurs. This current system contributes substantially to the transport and redistribution of heat (e.g., the poleward
flowing currents in the North Atlantic warm northwestern Europe by up to 10°C). Model simulations indicate that the North Atlantic branch of
this circulation system is particularly vulnerable to changes in atmospheric temperature and in the hydrological cycle. Such perturbations caused
by global warming could disrupt the current system, which would have a strong impact on regional-to-hemispheric climate. Note that this is a
schematic diagram and it does not give the exact locations of the water currents that form part of the THC.

     4.13   Most models project a weakening of the ocean thermohaline circulation, which                              WGI TAR SPM & WGI
                                                                                                                      TAR Sections 7.3 & 9.3.4
            leads to a reduction of the heat transport into high latitudes of Europe (see
            Figure 4-2). However, even in models where THC weakens, there is still a warming over
            Europe due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The current projections do
            not exhibit a complete shutdown of THC by the year 2100. Beyond the year 2100, some
            models suggest that THC could completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut down in either
            hemisphere if the change in radiative forcing is large enough and applied long enough.
            Models indicate that a decrease in THC reduces its resilience to perturbations (i.e., a once-
            reduced THC appears to be less stable and a shutdown can become more likely).

     4.14   The Antarctic ice sheet as a whole is likely to increase in mass during the                               WGI TAR Section 11.5.4
            21st century. However, the West Antarctic ice sheet could lose mass over the
            next 1,000 years with an associated sea-level rise of several meters, but there
            is an incomplete understanding of some of the underlying processes. Concerns
            have been expressed about the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet because it is grounded
            below sea level. However, loss of grounded ice leading to substantial sea-level rise from
            this source is widely agreed to be very unlikely during the 21st century. Current climate
            and ice dynamic models project that over the next 100 years the Antarctic ice sheet as a
            whole is likely to gain mass because of a projected increase in precipitation, contributing
            to a relative decrease of several centimeters to sea level. Over the next 1,000 years, these
            models project that the West Antarctic ice sheet could contribute up to 3 m to sea-level rise.

     4.15   The Greenland ice sheet is likely to lose mass during the 21st century and                                WGI TAR Section 11.5.4
            contribute a few centimeters to sea-level rise. Over the 21st century, the Greenland
            ice sheet is likely to lose mass because the projected increase in runoff will exceed the
            increase in precipitation and contribute 10 cm maximum to the total sea-level rise. The ice
            sheets will continue to react to climate warming and contribute to sea-level rise for thousands
            of years after climate has stabilized. Climate models indicate that the local warming over
            Greenland is likely to be one to three times the global average. Ice sheet models project
            that a local warming of larger than 3°C, if sustained for thousands of years, would lead to
            virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea-level rise of
            about 7 m. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for 1,000 years, would likely result in a
            contribution from Greenland of about 3 m to sea-level rise (see Question 3).

     4.16   Pronounced changes in permafrost temperature, surface morphology, and                                     WGII TAR Sections 16.1-2
            distribution are expected in the 21st century. Permafrost currently underlies 24.5%
            of the exposed land area of the Northern Hemisphere. Under climatic warming, much of
            this terrain would be vulnerable to subsidence, particularly in areas of relatively warm,
            discontinuous permafrost. The area of the Northern Hemisphere occupied by permafrost
            could eventually be reduced by 12 to 22% of its current extent and could eventually disappear
            from half the present-day Canadian permafrost region. The changes on the southern limit
            may become obvious by the late 21st century, but some thick ice-rich permafrost could
            persist in relict form for centuries or millennia. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be
            accompanied by mass movements and subsidence of the surface, possibly increasing the
            sediment loads in water courses and causing damage to the infrastructure in developed
            regions. Depending on the precipitation regime and drainage conditions, degradation of
            permafrost could lead to emission of greenhouse gases, conversion of forest to bogs,
            grasslands, or wetland ecosystems and could cause major erosion problems and landslides.

     4.17   Many natural and managed ecosystems may change abruptly
            or non-linearly during the 21st century. The greater the magnitude
            and rate of the change, the greater the risk of adverse impacts.

        function. For example, sustained increases in water temperatures of as little as 1°C, alone
        or in combination with any of several stresses (e.g., excessive pollution and siltation), can
        lead to corals ejecting their algae (coral bleaching; see Figure 4-3 and Question 2), the
        eventual death of the corals, and a possible loss of biodiversity. Climate change will also
        shift suitable habitats for many terrestrial and marine organisms polewards or terrestrial
        ones to higher altitudes in mountainous areas. Increased disturbances along with the shift
        in habitats and the more restrictive conditions needed for establishment of species could
        lead to abrupt and rapid breakdown of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which could
        result in new plant and animal assemblages that are less diverse, that include more “weedy”
        species, and that increase risk of extinctions (see Question 3).

4.19    Ecological systems have many interacting non-linear processes and are thus
        subject to abrupt changes and threshold effects arising from relatively small
        changes in driving variables, such as climate. For example:
         • Temperature increase beyond a threshold, which varies by crop and variety, can affect                            WGII SAR Sections 13.2.2
           key development stages of some crops and result in severe losses in crop yields. Examples                        & 13.6.2

           of key development stages and their critical thresholds include spikelet sterility in rice
           (e.g., temperatures greater than 35°C for more than 1 hour during the flowering and
           pollination process greatly reduce flower formation and eventually grain production),
           loss of pollen viability in maize (>35°C), reversal of cold-hardening in wheat (>30°C
           for more than 8 hours), and reduced formation of tubers and tuber bulking in potatoes
           (>20°C). Yield losses in these crops can be severe if temperatures exceed critical limits
           for even short periods.
         • Mangroves occupy a transition zone between sea and land that is set by a balance between                         WGII TAR Sections 5.3,

               processes from the sea might be expected to increase with sea-level rise, and the siltation
               processes through climate change and other human activities (e.g., coastal development).
               Thus, the impact on the mangrove forests will be determined by the balance between
               these two processes, which will determine whether mangrove systems migrate landward
               or seaward.

            climate and thus changing the disturbance regime (e.g., in the Arctic). In areas without
            surface water (typically semi-arid or arid), evapotranspiration and albedo affect the local
            hydrologic cycle, thus a reduction in vegetative cover could lead to reduced precipitation
            at the local/regional scale and change the frequency and persistence of droughts.

      Box 5-1     Time scale and inertia.
      The terms “time scale” and “inertia” have no generally accepted meaning across all the disciplines
      involved in the TAR. The following definitions are applied for the purpose of responding to this question:
        • “Time scale” is the time taken for a perturbation in a process to show at least half of its final effect.
          The time scales of some key Earth system processes are shown in Figure 5-1.
        • “Inertia” means a delay, slowness, or resistance in the response of climate, biological, or human
          systems to factors that alter their rate of change, including continuation of change in the system
          after the cause of that change has been removed.
      These are only two of several concepts used in the literature to describe the responses of complex,
      non-linear, adaptive systems to external forcing.

     of the process to have been expressed. Problems of adaptation arise when response process (such as the
     longevity of some plants) are much slower than driving process (the change in temperature). Inter-generational equity problems arise for all
     processes with time scales greater than a human generation, since a large part of the consequences of activities of a given generation will be
     borne by future generations.



     5.1      This response dicusses, and gives examples of, inertia and varying time scales associated
              with important processes in the interacting climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems.
              It then discusses potentially irreversible changes—that is, situations where parts of the
              climate, ecological, or socio-economic systems may fail to return to their former state
              within time scales of multiple human generations after the driving forces leading to change
              are reduced or removed. Finally, it explores how the effects of inertia may influence decisions
              regarding the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate change.

     5.2      Inertia is a widespread inherent characteristic of the interacting
              climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems. Thus some
              impacts of anthropogenic climate change may be slow to become
              apparent, and some could be irreversible if climate change is not
              limited in both rate and magnitude before associated thresholds,
              whose positions may be poorly known, are crossed.

        systems will only be achieved long after anthropogenic emissions of
        greenhouse gases have been reduced. The perturbation of the atmosphere and
        oceans, resulting from CO2 already emitted due to human activities since 1750, will persist
        for centuries because of the slow redistribution of carbon between large ocean and terrestrial
        reservoirs with slow turnover (see Figures 5-2 and 5-4). The future atmospheric concentration
        of CO2 is projected to remain for centuries near the highest level reached, since natural
        processes can only return the concentration to pre-industrial levels over geological time
        scales. By contrast, stabilization of emissions of shorter lived greenhouse gases such as
        CH4 leads, within decades, to stabilization of atmospheric concentrations. Inertia also implies
        that avoidance of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases has long-lasting benefits.

        up to 1,000 years. Due to the great mass, thickness, and thermal capacity of the oceans
        and cryosphere, and the slowness of the heat transport process, linked ocean-climate models
        predict that the average temperature of the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface will take
        hundreds of years to finally approach the new “equilibrium” temperature following a change
        in radiative forcing. Penetration of heat from the atmosphere into the upper “mixed layer”
        of the ocean occurs within decades, but transport of heat into the deep ocean requires
        centuries. An associated consequence is that human-induced sea-level rise will continue
        inexorably for many centuries after the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has
        been stabilized.

     5.5      The lower the stabilization target for atmospheric CO2, the sooner emissions                                                   WGI TAR Sections 3.2.3.2,
              of CO2 would need to decrease to meet it. If emissions were held at present levels,                                            3.7.3, & 9.3.3.1

              carbon cycle models indicate that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would continue to
              rise (see Figure 5-3).
                • Stabilization of CO2 concentrations at any level requires ultimate reduction of global
                  net emissions to a small fraction of the current emission level.
                • Stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require
                  global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to drop below the year 1990 level, within a few
                  decades, about a century, or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease
                  steadily thereafter (see Figure 6-1).
              These time constraints are partly due to the rate of CO2 uptake by the ocean, which is limited
              by the slow transport of carbon between the surface and deep waters. There is sufficient
              uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to 80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO2 emissions
              to the atmosphere, but this would take several centuries. Chemical reaction involving ocean
              sediments has the potential to remove up to a further 15% over a period of 5,000 years.

                                                                                                                                             Figure 3.10
              widely differing characteristic time scales (see Figures 5-1 and 5-4). The net terrestrial
              carbon uptake that has developed over the past few decades is partly a result of the time lag
              between photosynthetic carbon uptake and carbon release when plants eventually die and decay.
              For example, the uptake resulting from regrowth of forests on agricultural lands, abandoned
              over the last century in the Northern Hemisphere, will decline as the forests reach their mature
              biomass, growth slows, and death increases. Enhancement of plant carbon uptake due to elevated
              CO2 or nitrogen deposition will eventually saturate, then decomposition of the increased
              biomass will catch up. Climate change is likely to increase disturbance and decomposition
              rates in the future. Some models project that the recent global net terrestrial carbon uptake
              will peak, then level off or decrease. The peak could be passed within the 21st century
              according to several model projections. Projections of the global net terrestrial carbon
              exchange with the atmosphere beyond a few decades remain uncertain (see Figure 5-5).

        with ocean sediments takes millennia.

5.8     When subjected to rapid climate change, ecological systems are likely to be                                        WGII TAR Section 5.2
        disrupted as a consequence of the differences in response times within the
        system. The resulting loss of capacity by the ecosystem to supply services such as food,
        timber, and biodiversity maintenance on a sustainable basis may not be immediately apparent.
        Climate change may lead to conditions unsuitable for the establishment of key species, but
        the slow and delayed response of long-lived plants hides the importance of the change until
        the already established individuals die or are killed in a disturbance. For example, for
        climate change of the degree possible within the 21st century, it is likely, in some forests,
        that when a stand is disturbed by fire, wind, pests, or harvesting, instead of the community

              any experienced by human societies over at least the past 5 millennia. The magnitude and
              rate of these changes will pose a major challenge for humanity. The time needed for socio-
              economic adaptation varies from years to decades, depending on the sector and the resources
              available to assist the transition. There is inertia in decision making in the area of adaptation
              and mitigation, and in implementing those decisions, on the order of decades. The fact that
              adaptation and mitigation decisions are generally not made by the same entities compounds
              the difficulties inherent in the identification and implementation of the best possible
              combination of strategies, and hence contributes to the delays of climate change response.

     5.10     There is typically a delay of years to decades between perceiving a need to                                   WGII TAR Sections 1.4.1,

              and implementing it. This delay can be shortened by anticipating needs through the application                10.4
              of foresight, and thus developing technologies in advance. The response of technological
              development to energy price changes has historically been relatively rapid (typically, less
              than 5 years elapses between a price shock and the response in terms of patenting activity
              and introduction of new model offerings) but its diffusion takes much longer. The diffusion
              rate often depends on the rate of retirement of previously installed equipment. Early
              deployment of rapidly improving technologies allows learning-curve cost reductions
              (learning by doing), without premature lock-in to existing, low-efficiency technology. The
              rate of technology diffusion is strongly dependent not only on economic feasibility but also
              on socio-economic pressures. For some technologies, such as the adoption of new crop
              varieties, the availability of, and information on, pre-existing adaptation options allows for
              rapid adaptation. In many regions, however, population pressures on limited land and water
              resources, government policies impeding change, or limited access to information or
              financial resources make adaptation difficult and slow. Optimal adaptation to climate change
              trends, such as more frequent droughts, may be delayed if they are perceived to be due to
              natural variability, while they might actually be related to climate change. Conversely,
              maladaptation can occur if climate variability is mistaken for a trend.

       barriers. Unless advantages are very clear, social or behavioral changes on the part of technology
       users may require decades. Energy use and greenhouse gas mitigation are peripheral interests
       in most people’s everyday lives. Their consumption patterns are driven not only by demographic,
       economic and technological change, resource availability, infrastructure, and time constraints,
       but also by motivation, habit, need, compulsion, social structures, and other factors.

       severe economic conditions. For example, the oil crises of the 1970s triggered societal
       interest in energy conservation and alternative sources of energy, and the economy in most
       Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries deviated
       strongly from the traditional tie between energy consumption and economic development
       growth rates (see Figure 5-6). Another example is the observed reduction in CO2 emissions
       caused by the disruption of the economy of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries in
       1988. The response in both cases was very rapid (within a few years). The converse is also
       apparently true: In situations where pressure to change is small, inertia is large. This has
       implicitly been assumed to be the case in the SRES scenarios, since they do not consider
       major stresses, such as economic recession, large-scale conflict, or collapses in food stocks
       and associated human suffering, which are inherently difficult to forecast.

       greater than have been achieved historically. This implies shifts toward alternative
       development pathways with new social, institutional, and technological configurations that
       address environmental constraints. Low historical rates of improvement in energy intensity
       (energy use per unit GDP) reflect the relatively low priority placed on energy efficiency by
       most producers and users of technology. By contrast, labor productivity increased at higher
       rates over the period 1980 to 1992. The historically recorded annual rates of improvement
       of global energy intensity (1 to 1.5% per year) would have to be increased and maintained
       over long time frames to achieve stabilization of CO2 concentrations at about 600 ppm or
       below (see Figure 5-7). Carbon intensity (carbon per unit energy produced) reduction rates
       would eventually have to change by even more (e.g., up to 1.5% per year (the historical
       baseline is 0.3 to 0.4% per year)). In reality, both energy intensity and carbon intensity are
       likely to continue to improve, but greenhouse gas stabilization at levels below 600 ppm
       requires that at least one of them do so at a rate much higher than historically achieved. The
       lower the stabilization target and the higher the level of baseline emissions, the larger the
       CO2 divergence from the baseline that is needed, and the earlier it would need to occur.

5.14   Some climate, ecological, and socio-economic system changes
       are effectively irreversible over many human lifetimes, and
       others are intrinsically irreversible.

5.15   There are two types of apparent irreversibility. “Effective irreversibility” derives                         WGI TAR Chapter 11, WGII
       from processes that have the potential to return to their pre-disturbance state, but take                    TAR Chapter 5, & WGII TAR

       centuries to millennia to do so. An example is the partial melting of the Greenland ice
       sheet. Another is the projected rise in mean sea level, partly as a result of melting of the
       cryosphere, but primarily due to thermal expansion of the oceans. The world is already
       committed to some sea-level rise as a consequence of the surface atmospheric warming
       that has occurred over the past century. “Intrinsic irreversibility” results from crossing a
       threshold beyond which the system no longer spontaneously returns to the previous state.
       An example of an intrinsically irreversible change due to crossing a threshold is the extinction
       of species, resulting from a combination of climate change and habitat loss.

              that a threshold may exist in the ocean thermohaline circulation (see Question 4) such that
              a transition to a new ocean circulation, as occurred during the emergence from the last
              glacial period, could be induced if the world warms rapidly. While such a transition is very
              unlikely during the 21st century, some models suggest that it would be irreversible (i.e., the
              new circulation would persist even after the perturbation disappeared). For slower rates of
              warming, THC would likely gradually adjust and thresholds may not be crossed. This
              implies that the greenhouse gas emission trajectory is important in determining the evolution
              of THC. When a system approaches a threshold, as is the case for a weakening THC under
              global warming, resilience to perturbations decreases.

              climate. Fossil records indicate that the maximum rate at which most plant species have
              migrated in the past is about 1 km per year. Known constraints imposed by the dispersal
              process (e.g., the mean period between germination and the production of seeds, and the
              mean distance that an individual seed can travel) suggest that, without human intervention,
              many species would not be able to keep up with the rate of movement of their preferred
              climatic niche projected for the 21st century, even if there were no barriers to their movement
              imposed by land use. An example of a socio-economic threshold is provided by conflicts in
              already stressed situations—for example, a river basin shared by several nations with

            not fully understood, the presence of a threshold may not be apparent until it is reached.

5.18        Inertia in the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems
            makes adaptation inevitable and already necessary in some
            cases, and inertia affects the optimal mix of adaptation and
            mitigation strategies.

5.19        As a result of the time lags and inertias inherent in the Earth system, including                                         WGIII TAR Section 8.4.2
            its social components, some of the consequences of actions taken, or not
            taken, will only be felt many years in the future. For example, the differences in the
            initial trajectories of the various SRES and stabilization scenarios are small, but the outcomes
            in terms of the climate in the year 2100 are large. The choice of development path has
            consequences at all the affected time scales; thus, long-term total costs and benefits may
            differ considerably from short-term ones.

            development and capital stock replacement is an important argument for gradual mitigation.
            The essential point of inertia in economic structures and processes is that deviation from any
            given trend incurs costs, and these costs rise with the speed of deviations (e.g., the costs of
            early retirement of carbon-intensive facilities). Earlier mitigation action may reduce the
            risk of incurring severe lasting or irreversible impacts, while reducing the need for more
            rapid mitigation later. Accelerated action may help to drive down the costs of mitigation and

            adaptation in the long term by accelerating technology development and the early realization
            of benefits currently obscured by market imperfections. Abatement over the next few years
            is economically valuable if there is a significant probability of having to stay below ceilings
            that would otherwise be reached within the characteristic time scales of the systems
            producing greenhouse gases. Climate change mitigation decisions depend on the interplay
            of inertia and uncertainty, resulting in a sequential decision-making process. Foresight and
            early adaptation will be most advantageous in sectors with long-lived infrastructure, such
            as dams and bridges, and large social inertia, such as misallocated property rights.
            Anticipatory adaptive action can be very cost-effective if the anticipated trend materializes.

            means that a mitigation action or technology development can have different
            outcomes, depending on when it is taken. For example, in one model analysis of
            the hypothetical effect of reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero in the
            year 1995, on sea-level rise during the 21st century in the Pacific, showed that the sea-level
            rise that would inevitably occur due to warming incurred to 1995 (5 to 12 cm) would be
            substantially less than if the same emission reduction occurred in the year 2020 (14 to 32
            cm). This demonstrates the increasing commitment to future sea-level rise due to past and
            present emissions, and the effect of delaying the hypothetical emissions reduction.

            will automatically follow the past development paths of industrialized countries. For
            example, some developing countries have bypassed land-lines for communication, and
            proceeded directly to mobile phones. Developing countries could avoid the past energy-
            inefficient practices of developed countries by adopting technologies that use energy in a
            more sustainable way, recycling more wastes and products, and handling residual wastes in
            a more acceptable manner. This may be easier to achieve in new infrastructure and energy
            systems in developing countries since large investments are needed in any case. Transfer

            imply that safety margins should be considered in setting strategies, targets,
                                                                                                                      10.1.4.1-3
            and time tables for avoiding dangerous levels of interference in the climate
            system. Stabilization target levels of, for instance, atmospheric CO2 concentration,
            temperature, or sea level may be affected by:
              • The inertia of the climate system, which will cause climate change to continue for a
                period after mitigation actions are implemented
              • Uncertainty regarding the location of possible thresholds of irreversible change and the
                behavior of the system in their vicinity
              • The time lags between adoption of mitigation goals and their achievement.
            Similarly, adaptation is affected by time lags involved in identifying climate change impacts,
            developing effective adaptation strategies, and implementing adaptive measures. Hedging
            strategies and sequential decision making (iterative action, assessment, and revised action)
            may be appropriate responses to the combination of inertia and uncertainty. Inertia has
            different consequences for adaptation than for mitigation, with adaptation being primarily
            oriented to address localized impacts of climate change, while mitigation aims to address
            the impacts on the climate system. Both issues involve time lags and inertia, with inertia
            suggesting a generally greater sense of urgency for mitigation.

     5.24   The pervasiveness of inertia and the possibility of irreversibility in the interacting
            climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems are major reasons why
            anticipatory adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial. A number of
            opportunities to exercise adaptation and mitigation options may be lost if action is delayed.

Question 6

a)   How does the extent and timing of the introduction of a range of
     emissions reduction actions determine and affect the rate, magnitude,
     and impacts of climate change, and affect the global and regional
     economy, taking into account the historical and current emissions?

b)   What is known from sensitivity studies about regional and global
     climatic, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of stabilizing
     the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (in carbon
     dioxide equivalents), at a range of levels from today’s to double that
     level or more, taking into account to the extent possible the effects of
     aerosols? For each stabilization scenario, including different pathways
     to stabilization, evaluate the range of costs and benefits, relative to
     the range of scenarios considered in Question 3, in terms of:
      • Projected changes in atmospheric concentrations, climate, and
        sea level, including changes beyond 100 years
      • Impacts and economic costs and benefits of changes in climate
        and atmospheric composition on human health, diversity and
        productivity of ecological systems, and socio-economic sectors
        (particularly agriculture and water)
      • The range of options for adaptation, including the costs, benefits,
        and challenges
      • The range of technologies, policies, and practices that could be
        used to achieve each of the stabilization levels, with an evaluation
        of the national and global costs and benefits, and an assessment
        of how these costs and benefits would compare, either qualitatively
        or quantitatively, to the avoided environmental harm that would
        be achieved by the emissions reductions
      • Development, sustainability, and equity issues associated with
        impacts, adaptation, and mitigation at a regional and global level.

     6.1        The climatic, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of greenhouse gas emissions
                were assessed in Question 3 for scenarios that do not include any climate policy interventions.
                These same issues are addressed here in Question 6, but this time to assess the benefits that
                would result from a set of climate policy interventions. Among the emission reduction
                scenarios considered are scenarios that would achieve stabilization of CO2 concentrations
                in the atmosphere. The role of adaptation as a complement to mitigation and the potential
                contributions of reducing emissions to the goals of sustainable development and equity are
                evaluated. The policies and technologies that might be used to implement the emission
                reductions and their costs are considered in Question 7.

     6.2        The projected rate and magnitude of warming and sea-level rise
                can be lessened by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

     6.3        The greater the reductions in emissions and the earlier they are introduced,                                        IPCC TP4
                the smaller and slower the projected warming and rise in sea levels. Future
                climate change is determined by historic, current, and future emissions. Estimates have
                been made of the global mean temperature and sea-level rise effects of a 2% per year
                reduction in CO2 emissions by developed countries over the period 2000 to 2100, assuming
                that developing countries do not reduce their emissions.6 Under these assumptions, global
                emissions and the atmospheric concentration of CO2 grow throughout the century but at a
                diminished rate compared to scenarios that assume no actions to reduce developed country
                emissions. The effects of the emission limit accrue slowly but build with time. By the year
                2030, the projected concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is reduced roughly 20% relative
                to the IS92a scenario of unabated emissions, which diminishes warming and sea-level rise
                by a small amount within this time frame. By the year 2100, the projected CO2 concentration
                is reduced by 35% relative to the IS92a scenario, projected global mean warming reduced
                by 25%, and projected sea-level rise reduced by 20%. Analyses of CO2 emission reductions
                of 1% per year by developed countries indicate that the lesser reductions would yield
                smaller reductions in CO2 concentration, temperature change, and sea-level rise. Actions
                such as these taken now would have a greater effect at the year 2100 than the same emissions
                reductions implemented at a later time.

     6.4        Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that control their                                             WGI TAR Section 3.7.3
                concentration would be necessary to stabilize radiative forcing. For example,
                for the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that
                stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require
                global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades,
                about a century, or about 2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter
                (see Figure 6-1). These models illustrate that emissions would peak in about 1 to 2 decades
                (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm) from the present (see Table 6-1). Eventually
                CO2 emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of current emissions. The
                benefits of different stabilization levels are discussed later in Question 6 and the costs of
                these stabilization levels are discussed in Question 7.

     6.5        There is a wide band of uncertainty in the amount of warming that would result                                      WGI TAR Section 9.3.3
                from any stabilized greenhouse gas concentration. Estimates of global mean
                temperature change for scenarios that would stabilize the concentration of CO2 at different
                levels, and hold them constant thereafter, are presented in Figure 6-1c. The uncertainty about
                climate sensitivity yields a wide range of estimates of temperature change that would result


     6
         In these analyses, emissions by developed countries of CH4, N2O, and SO2 are kept constant at their year 1990
         values, and halocarbons follow a scenario consistent with the Copenhagen version of the Montreal Protocol.
         Developing country emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are assumed to follow the IS92 scenario
         projections. The temperature projections were made with a simple climate model. The IS92 scenarios are described
         in the IPCC Special Report on Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.

a)     CO2 emissions: The time paths of CO2 emissions that would lead to stabilization of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere at 450,
       550, 650, 750, and 1,000 ppm are estimated for the WRE stabilization profiles using carbon cycle models. Lower CO2 concentration
       levels would require an earlier reversal of emissions growth and earlier decreases to levels below current emissions. The shaded area
       illustrates the range of uncertainty in estimating CO2 emissions corresponding to specified concentration time paths, as represented in
       carbon cycle models. Also shown for comparison are CO2 emissions for three of the SRES scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1), which do not
       include greenhouse gas emission limits.
b)     CO2 concentrations: The CO2 concentrations specified for the WRE profiles gradually approach stabilized levels that range from 450
       to 1,000 ppm. Also shown for comparison are estimates of CO2 concentrations that would result from three of the SRES projections of
       emissions (A1B, A2, and B1).
c)     Global mean temperature changes: Global mean temperature changes are estimated for the WRE stabilization profiles using a simple
       climate model tuned in turn to each of several more complex models. Estimated warming slows as growth in the atmospheric concentration
       of CO2 slows and warming continues after the time at which the CO2 concentration is stabilized (indicated by black spots) but at a much
       diminished rate. It is assumed that emissions of gases other than CO2 follow the SRES A1B projection until the year 2100 and are constant
       thereafter. This scenario was chosen as it is in the middle of the range of the SRES scenarios. The dashed lines show the temperature
       changes projected for the S profiles, an alternate set of CO2 stabilization profiles (not shown in panels (a) or (b)). The shaded area
       illustrates the effect of a range of climate sensitivity across the five stabilization cases. The colored bars on the righthand side show, for
       each WRE profile, the range at the year 2300 due to the different climate model tunings and the diamonds on the righthand side show
       the equilibrium (very long-term) warming for each stabilization level using average climate model results. Also shown for comparison
       are temperature increases in the year 2100 estimated for the SRES emission scenarios (indicated by red crosses).

          b   1990 emissions are taken to be 7.8 Gt C; this value is uncertain primarily due to the uncertainty in the size of the land-use change

                  in Figure 6-2, which shows eventual CO2 concentration stabilization levels and the corresponding
                  range of temperature change that is estimated to be realized in the year 2100 and at long-run
                  equilibrium. To estimate temperature changes for these scenarios, it is assumed that emissions
                  of greenhouse gases other than CO2 would follow the SRES A1B scenario until the year
                  2100 and that emissions of these gases would be constant thereafter. Different assumptions
                  about emissions of other greenhouse gases would result in different estimates of warming
                  for each CO2 stabilization level.

                  of CO2 at a level below 1,000 ppm, based on profiles shown in Figure 6-1, and
                  assuming that emissions of gases other than CO2 follow the SRES A1B
                  projection until the year 2100 and are constant thereafter, are estimated to
                  limit global mean temperature increase to 3.5oC or less through the year 2100.
                  Global average surface temperature is estimated to increase 1.2 to 3.5°C by the year 2100
                  for profiles that would limit CO2 emissions so as to eventually stabilize the concentration
                  of CO2 at a level from 450 to 1,000 ppm. Thus, although all of the CO2 concentration
                  stabilization profiles analyzed would prevent, during the 21st century, much of the upper
                  end of the SRES projections of warming (1.4 to 5.8°C by the year 2100), it should be noted
                  that for most of the profiles the concentration of CO2 would continue to rise beyond the
                  year 2100. Owing to the large inertia of the ocean (see Question 5), temperatures are
                  projected to continue to rise even after stabilization of CO2 and other greenhouse gas
                  concentrations, though at a rate that is slower than is projected for the period prior to
                  stabilization and that diminishes with time. The equilibrium temperature rise would take
                  many centuries to reach, and ranges from 1.5 to 3.9°C above the year 1990 levels for

          The equilibrium global mean temperature response to doubling atmospheric CO2 is often used as a measure of
          climate sensitivity. The temperatures shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2 are derived from a simple model calibrated to
          give the same response as a number of complex models that have climate sensitivities ranging from 1.7 to 4.2°C.
          This range is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C.

          stabilization at 450 ppm and 3.5 to 8.7°C above the year 1990 levels for stabilization at
          1,000 ppm.8 Furthermore, for a specific temperature stabilization target, there is a very
          wide range of uncertainty associated with the required stabilization level of greenhouse
          gas concentration (see Figure 6-2). The level at which CO2 concentration is required to be
          stabilized for a given temperature target also depends on the levels of the non-CO2 gases.
          Results from the only comprehensive climate model that has been used to analyze the
          regional effects of stabilizing CO2 concentrations project that regionally averaged
          temperature changes would be similar in geographic pattern but less in magnitude than
          those projected for a baseline scenario with a 1% per year increase in CO2 emissions from
          the year 1990.9

          of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases yield different time
          paths of temperature change. For CO2 stabilization levels of 450, 550, 650, and 750

  For all these scenarios, the contribution to the equilibrium warming from other greenhouse gases and aerosols is
  0.6°C for a low climate sensitivity and 1.4°C for a high climate sensitivity. The accompanying increase in radiative
  forcing is equivalent to that occurring with an additional 28% in the final CO2 concentrations.

  This rate of emission growth closely approximates the IS92a emission scenario.

                 referred to as the S and WRE profiles.10 The WRE profiles allow higher emissions in early
                 decades than do the S profiles, but then must require lower emissions in later decades to
                 achieve a specified stabilization level. This deferment of emission reductions in the WRE
                 profiles is estimated to reduce mitigation costs (see Question 7) but would result in a more
                 rapid rate of warming initially. The difference in temperature projections for the two sets of
                 pathways is 0.2oC or less in the year 2050, when the difference is most pronounced. Beyond
                 the year 2100, the temperature changes of the WRE and S profiles converge. The temperature
                 projections for the S and WRE profiles are compared in Figure 6-1c.

                 after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized (see Question 5).
                 The projected range of sea-level rise due to thermal expansion at equilibrium is 0.5 to 2 m
                 for an increase in CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level of 280 to 560 ppm and 1
                 to 4 m for an increase in CO2 concentration from 280 to 1,120 ppm. The observed rise over
                 the 20th century was 0.1 to 0.2 m. The projected rise would be larger if the effect of increases
                 in other greenhouse gas concentrations were to be taken into account. There are other contributions
                 to sea-level rise over time scales of centuries to millennia (see Question 5). Models assessed
                 in the TAR project sea-level rise of several meters from polar ice sheets (see Question 4)

      6.9        Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to stabilize their
                 atmospheric concentrations would delay and reduce damages
                 caused by climate change.

                 pressures on natural and human systems from climate change. Slower rates of
                 increase in global mean temperature and sea level would allow more time for adaptation.
                 Consequently, mitigation actions are expected to delay and reduce damages caused by
                 climate change and thereby generate environmental and socio-economic benefits. Mitigation
                 actions and their associated costs are assessed in the response to Question 7.

                 Stabilization at lower levels reduces the risk of exceeding temperature thresholds in
                 biophysical systems where these exist. Stabilization of CO2 at, for example, 450 ppm is
                 estimated to yield an increase in global mean temperature in the year 2100 that is about
                 0.75 to 1.25oC less than is estimated for stabilization at 1,000 ppm (see Figure 6-2). At
                 equilibrium the difference is about 2 to 5oC. The geographical extent of the damage to or
                 loss of natural systems, and the number of systems affected, which increase with the
                 magnitude and rate of climate change, would be lower for a lower stabilization level.
                 Similarly, for a lower stabilization level the severity of impacts from climate extremes is
                 expected to be less, fewer regions would suffer adverse net market sector impacts, global
                 aggregate impacts would be smaller, and risks of large-scale high-impact events would be
                 reduced. Figure 6-3 presents a summary of climate change risks or reasons for concern
                 (see Box 3-2) juxtaposed against the ranges of global mean temperature change in the year
                 2100 that have been estimated for different scenarios.11

           and seasonal changes in mean temperature and precipitation, climate variability, the frequencies and intensities

change, where global mean temperature change is used as a proxy for the magnitude of climate change.
Estimates of global mean temperature change by the year 2100 relative to the year 1990 are shown on the righthand side of the figure for
scenarios that would lead to stabilization of the atmospheric concentration of CO2, as well as for the full set of SRES projections. Many risks
associated with warming above 3.5oC by the year 2100 would be avoided by stabilizing CO2 concentration at or below 1,000 ppm. Stabilization
at a lower level would reduce risks further. White indicates neutral or small negative or small positive impacts or risks; yellow indicates negative
impacts for some systems or low risks; and red means negative impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or greater in magnitude. The
assessment of impacts or risks takes into account only the magnitude of change and not the rate of change. Global mean annual temperature
change is used as a proxy for the magnitude of climate change, but impacts would be a function of, among other factors, the magnitude and rate
of global and regional changes in mean climate, climate variability and extreme climate phenomena, social and economic conditions, and
adaptation.

                 While advances have been made in understanding the qualitative character of the impacts
                 of future climate change, the impacts that would result under different scenarios are
                 incompletely quantified. Because of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, and uncertainty about
                 the geographic and seasonal patterns of changes in temperatures, precipitation, and other
                 climate variables and phenomena, the impacts of climate change cannot be uniquely
                 determined for individual emission scenarios. There are also uncertainties about key
                 processes and sensitivities and adaptive capacities of systems to changes in climate. In
                 addition, impacts such as changes in the composition and function of ecological systems,
                 species extinction, and changes in human health, and disparity in the distribution of impacts
                 across different populations and regions, are not readily expressed in monetary or other
                 common units. Because of these limitations, the benefits of different greenhouse gas
                 reduction actions, including actions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at selected
                 levels, are incompletely characterized and cannot be compared directly to mitigation costs
                 for the purpose of estimating the net economic effects of mitigation.

      6.13       Adaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement
                 climate change mitigation efforts. Together they can contribute
                 to sustainable development objectives.

      6.14       Adaptation can complement mitigation in a cost-effective strategy to reduce                                         WGII TAR Sections 1.4.4.2,
                                                                                                                                     18.3.5, & 18.4.1
                 climate change risks. Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, even stabilization of
                 their concentrations in the atmosphere at a low level, will neither altogether prevent climate
                 change or sea-level rise nor altogether prevent their impacts. Many reactive adaptations
                 will occur in response to the changing climate and rising seas and some have already occurred.
                 In addition, the development of planned adaptation strategies to address risks and utilize
                 opportunities can complement mitigation actions to lessen climate change impacts. However,
                 adaptation would entail costs and cannot prevent all damages. Adaptation implemented in
                 combination with mitigation can be a more cost-effective approach to reducing the impacts
                 of climate change than either applied alone. The potential for adaptation to substantially
                 reduce many of the adverse impacts of climate change was assessed in Question 3. Because
                 there are overlapping ranges of global temperature increases associated with the various
                 stabilization levels (see Figure 6-1c), many adaptation options will be appropriate for a
                 range of stabilization levels. Improved knowledge will narrow the uncertainties associated
                 with particular stabilization levels and identification of appropriate adaptation strategies.

      6.15       Adaptation costs and challenges can be lessened by mitigation of climate                                            WGII TAR Sections 18.2.2,
                                                                                                                                     18.3, & 18.8
                 change. Greenhouse gas emission reductions would reduce the magnitude and rate of
                 changes to be adapted to, possibly including changes in the frequencies and intensities of
                 extreme events. The smaller changes to which systems would be exposed, and slower pace
                 at which stresses would increase, would allow more time for adaptation and lessen the
                 degree to which current practices for coping with climate variability and extremes might
                 need to be modified (see Question 3). More aggressive mitigation efforts will therefore
                 reduce adaptation costs to attain a specified level of effectiveness.

      6.16       Mitigation and adaptation actions can, if appropriately designed, advance                                           WGII TAR Section 18.6.1, &

                 sustainable development objectives. As described in Question 3, risks associated
                                                                                                                                     10.3.2

                 (e.g., damages from extreme climate events, water shortage and degraded water quality,
                 food supply disruptions and hunger, land degradation, and diminished human health). By
                 reducing these risks, climate change mitigation and adaptation policies can improve the
                 prospects for sustainable development.12

       and between countries. The challenge of addressing climate change raises                                 & 19.4

       an important issue of equity. Climate change pressures can exacerbate inequities
       between developing and developed countries; lessening these pressures through mitigation
       and enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce these inequities. People in developing
       countries, particularly the poorest people in these countries, are considered to be more
       vulnerable to climate change than people in developed countries (see Question 3). Reducing
       the rate of warming and sea-level rise and increasing the capacity to adapt to climate change
       would benefit all countries, particularly developing countries.

       inertia in the atmosphere-ocean-climate system and the long-lived and sometimes irreversible
       effects of climate change on the environment. Future generations are generally anticipated
       to be wealthier, better educated and informed, and technologically more advanced than the
       present generation and consequently better able to adapt in many respects. But the changes
       set in motion in coming decades will accumulate and some could reach magnitudes that
       would severely test the abilities of many societies to cope. For irreversible impacts, such as
       the extinction of species or loss of unique ecosystems, there are no adaptation responses
       that can fully remedy the losses. Mitigating climate change would lessen the risks to future
       generations from the actions of the present generation.

      7.1        This question focuses on the potential for, and costs of, mitigation both in the near and long
                 term. The issue of the primary mitigation benefits (the avoided costs and damages of slowing
                 climate change) is addressed in Questions 5 and 6, and that of ancillary mitigation benefits
                 is addressed in this response and the one to Question 8. This response describes a variety
                 of factors that contribute to significant differences and uncertainties in the quantitative estimates
                 of the costs of mitigation options. The SAR described two categories of approaches to estimating
                 costs: bottom-up approaches, which often assess near-term cost and potential, and are built
                 up from assessments of specific technologies and sectors; and top-down approaches, which
                 proceed from macro-economic relationships. These two approaches lead to differences in
                 the estimates of costs, which have been narrowed since the SAR. The response below
                 reports on cost estimates from both approaches for the near term, and from the top-down
                 approach for the long term. Mitigation options and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas
                 emissions and sequester carbon are discussed first. This is followed by a discussion of the
                 costs for achieving emissions reductions to meet near-term emissions constraints, and long-
                 term stabilization goals, and the timing of reductions to achieve such goals. This response
                 concludes with a discussion of equity as it relates to climate change mitigation.

                 are taking place in a wide range of technologies at different stages of development—for
                 example, the market introduction of wind turbines; the rapid elimination of industrial by-product
                 gases, such as N2O from adipic acid production and perfluorocarbons from aluminum production;
                 efficient hybrid engine cars; the advancement of fuel cell technology; and the demonstration
                 of underground CO2 storage. Technological options for emissions reduction include improved
                 efficiency of end-use devices and energy conversion technologies, shift to zero- and low-carbon
                 energy technologies, improved energy management, reduction of industrial by-product and
                 process gas emissions, and carbon removal and storage. Table 7-1 summarizes the results
                 from many sectoral studies, largely at the project, national, and regional level with some at
                 the global level, providing estimates of potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions to
                 the 2010 and 2020 time frame.

                 carbon mitigation potential. Conservation and sequestration of carbon, although
                 not necessarily permanent, may allow time for other options to be further
                 developed and implemented (see Table 7-2). Biological mitigation can occur by three
                 strategies: a) conservation of existing carbon pools, b) sequestration by increasing the size
                 of carbon pools,13 and c) substitution of sustainably produced biological products (e.g.,
                 wood for energy-intensive construction products and biomass for fossil fuels). Conservation
                 of threatened carbon pools may help to avoid emissions, if leakage can be prevented, and
                 can only become sustainable if the socio-economic drivers for deforestation and other
                 losses of carbon pools can be addressed. Sequestration reflects the biological dynamics of
                 growth, often starting slowly, passing through a maximum, and then declining over decades
                 to centuries. The potential of biological mitigation options is on the order of 100 Gt C
                 (cumulative) by the year 2050, equivalent to about 10 to 20% of projected fossil-fuel
                 emissions during that period, although there are substantial uncertainties associated with

      13
           Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO2 concentration. Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released
           by historical land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere over the course of the century (e.g.,
           by reforestation), CO2 concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm.

 c   Included in sector values above. Reductions include electricity generation options only (fuel switching to gas/nuclear, CO2 capture
     and storage, improved power station efficiencies, and renewables).
 d   Total includes all sectors reviewed in WGIII TAR Chapter 3 for all six gases. It excludes non-energy related sources of CO2 (cement
     production, 160 Mt C; gas flaring, 60 Mt C; and land-use change, 600–1,400 Mt C) and energy used for conversion of fuels in the
     end-use sector totals (630 Mt C). If petroleum refining and coke oven gas were added, global year 1990 CO2 emissions of 7,100 Mt C
     would increase by 12%. Note that forestry emissions and their carbon sink mitigation options are not included.
 e   The baseline SRES scenarios (for six gases included in the Kyoto Protocol) project a range of emissions of 11,500–14,000 Mt Ceq for
     the year 2010 and of 12,000–16,000 Mt Ceq for the year 2020. The emissions reduction estimates are most compatible with baseline
     emissions trends in the SRES B2 scenario. The potential reductions take into account regular turnover of capital stock. They are not
     limited to cost-effective options, but exclude options with costs above US$100 t Ceq (except for Montreal Protocol gases) or options
     that will not be adopted through the use of generally accepted policies.




          this estimate. Realization of this potential depends upon land and water availability as well
          as the rates of adoption of land management practices. The largest biological potential for
          atmospheric carbon mitigation is in subtropical and tropical regions.

7.5       Adoption of opportunities including greenhouse gas-reducing
          technologies and measures may require overcoming barriers

                would need to overcome technical, economic, political, cultural, social,
                behavioral, and/or institutional barriers that prevent the full exploitation of
                the technological, economic, and social opportunities of these mitigation
                options (see Figure 7-1). The potential mitigation opportunities and types of barriers
                vary by region and sector, and over time. Most countries could benefit from innovative
                financing, social learning and innovation, and institutional reforms, removing barriers to
                trade, and poverty eradication. This is caused by a wide variation in mitigation capacity.
                The poor in any country are faced with limited opportunities to adopt technologies or
                change their social behavior, particularly if they are not part of a cash economy. Most
                countries could benefit from innovative financing and institutional reform and removing
                barriers to trade. In the industrialized countries, future opportunities lie primarily in removing
                social and behavioral barriers; in countries with economies in transition, in price
                rationalization; and in developing countries, in price rationalization, increased access to
                data and information, availability of advanced technologies, financial resources, and training
                and capacity building. Opportunities for any given country, however, might be found in the

                 with industries, direct transfers of financial resources and technology, and coordinated
                 creation of enabling environments such as reduction of fossil-fuel subsidies. Some of these
                 have been considered only in some regions to date.

                 major element of global strategies to achieve sustainable development and climate change
                 mitigation. The local availability of technical, business, management, and regulatory skills
                 can enhance the flow of international capital, helping to promote technology transfer. Technical
                 skills are enhanced by the creation of competence in associated services, organizational
                 know-how, and capacity improvement to formulate and enforce regulations. Capacity building
                 is a continuous process that needs to keep up with the evolution of mitigation options as
                 they respond to technological and social changes.

 For a variety of reasons, significant differences and uncertainties surround specific quantitative estimates             WGIII TAR Box SPM-2
 of mitigation costs. Cost estimates differ because of the (a) methodology used in the analysis, and (b)
 underlying factors and assumptions built into the analysis. Bottom-up models incorporate detailed
 studies of engineering costs of a wide range of available and anticipated technologies, and describe
 energy consumption in great detail. However, they typically incorporate relatively little detail on non-
 energy consumer behavior and interactions with other sectors of the economy. The costs estimated by
 bottom-up models can range from negative values (due to the adoption of “no-regrets” options) to
 positive values. Negative costs indicate that the direct energy benefits of a mitigation option exceed its
 direct costs (net capital, operating, and maintenance costs). Market and institutional barriers, however,
 can prevent, delay, or make more costly the adoption of these options. Inclusion of implementation and
 policy costs would add to the costs estimated by bottom-up models.

 Top-down models are aggregate models of the economy that often draw on analysis of historical trends
 and relationships to predict the large-scale interactions between sectors of the economy, especially the
 interactions between the energy sector and the rest of the economy. Top-down models typically
 incorporate relatively little detail on energy consumption and technological change. The costs estimated
 by top-down models usually range from zero to positive values. This is because negative cost options
 estimated in bottom-up models are assumed to be adopted in both the baseline and policy scenarios.
 This is an important factor in the differences in the estimates from these two types of models.

 The inclusion of some factors will lead to lower cost estimates and others to higher estimates.
 Incorporating multiple greenhouse gases, sinks, induced technical change, and emissions trading can
 lower costs. Further, studies suggest that some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at
 no or negative net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no-regret opportunities such as
 correcting market imperfections, inclusion of ancillary benefits, and efficient tax revenue recycling.
 International cooperation that facilitates cost-effective emissions reductions can lower mitigation costs.
 On the other hand, accounting for potential short-term macro shocks to the economy, constraints on the
 use of domestic and international market mechanisms, high transaction costs, inclusion of ancillary
 costs, and ineffective tax recycling measures can increase estimated costs. Since no analysis
 incorporates all relevant factors affecting mitigation costs, estimated costs may not reflect the actual costs
 of implementing mitigation actions.



       limiting fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emissions vary widely and depend on choice of
       methodologies, underlying assumptions, emissions scenarios, policy instruments, reporting
       year, and other criteria.

7.15   Bottom-up studies indicate that substantial low-cost mitigation opportunities                                      WGIII TAR Sections 1.5,
                                                                                                                          3.3-8, 5.3-4, & 6.2
       exist. According to bottom-up assessments (see Box 7-1) of specific technologies and sectors,
       half of the potential emissions reductions noted in Table 7-1 may be achieved by the year
       2020 with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, and the other half at a net direct cost of up
       to US$100 per t Ceq (at 1998 prices). However, for reasons described below, the realized potential
       may be different. These cost estimates are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to
       12%, consistent with public-sector discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly,
       and are often significantly higher, affecting the rate of adoption of these technologies by
       private entities. Depending on the emissions scenario, this could allow global emissions to be
       reduced below year 2000 levels in the period 2010–2020 at these net direct costs. Realizing
       these reductions involves additional implementation costs, which in some cases may be
       substantial, the possible need for supporting policies, increased R&D, effective technology
       transfer, and overcoming other barriers. The various global, regional, national, sector, and project
       studies assessed in the WGIII TAR have different scopes and assumptions. Studies do not
       exist for every sector and region.

7.16   Cost estimates using bottom-up analyses reported to date for biological                                            WGIII TAR Sections 4.3-4
       mitigation vary significantly and do not consistently account for all significant
       components of cost. Cost estimates using bottom-up analyses reported to date for biological
       mitigation vary significantly from US$0.1 to about US$20 per t C in several tropical countries
       and from US$20 to US$100 per t C in non-tropical countries. Methods of financial analyses
       and carbon accounting have not been comparable. Moreover, the cost calculations do not cover,
       in many instances, inter alia, costs for infrastructure, appropriate discounting, monitoring,
       data collection and implementation costs, opportunity costs of land and maintenance, or

                 other recurring costs, which are often excluded or overlooked. The lower end of the range
                 is assessed to be biased downwards, but understanding and treatment of costs is improving

                 Annex B emissions trade for meeting a given near-term CO2 emissions target as
                 reported by several models15 of the global economy (top-down models) vary
                 within regions (as shown by the brown lines in Figure 7-2a for Annex II regions
                 and in Table 7-3a). Reasons for the differentiation among models within regions is due to
                 varying assumptions about future GDP growth rates and changes in carbon and energy
                 intensity (different socio-economic development paths). The same reasons also apply to
                 differences across regions. These models assume that national policy instruments are efficient
                 and consistent with international policy instruments. That is, they assume that reductions
                 are made through the use of market mechanisms (e.g., cap and trade) within each region.
                 To the extent that regions employ a mix of market mechanisms and command and control
                 policies, costs will likely be higher. On the other hand, inclusion of carbon sinks, non-CO2
                 greenhouse gases, induced technical change, ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling
                 could reduce costs.

                 important in controlling risks of high costs in given countries, and thus could
                 complement domestic policy mechanisms, and could minimize risks of
                 inequitable international impacts. For example, the brown and blue lines in Figure 7-2b
                 and Table 7-3b show that the national marginal costs to meet the Kyoto targets range from
                 about US$20 up to US$600 per t C without Annex B trading, and range from about US$15
                 up to US$150 per t C with Annex B trading, respectively. At the time of these studies, most
                 models did not include sinks, non-CO2 greenhouse gases, CDM, negative cost options,
                 ancillary benefits, or targeted revenue recycling, which will reduce estimated costs. On the
                 other hand, these models make assumptions which underestimate costs because they assume
                 full use of emissions trading without transaction costs, both within and among Annex B
                 countries, and that mitigation responses would be perfectly efficient and that economies
                 begin to adjust to the need to meet Kyoto targets between the years 1990 and 2000. The
                 cost reductions from Annex B trading will depend on the details of implementation, including
                 the compatibility of domestic and international mechanisms, constraints, and transaction
                 costs. The following is indicative of the broad variation in the change in GDP reported for
                 Annex B countries:
                   • For Annex II countries, the above modeling studies show reductions in GDP, compared
                     to projected levels in the year 2010. Figure 7-2 indicates that in the absence of Annex
                     B trading losses range from 0.2 to 2% of GDP. With Annex B trading, losses range from
                     0.1 to 1% of GDP. National studies, which explore a more diverse set of policy packages
                     and take account of specific national circumstances, vary even more widely.
                   • For most economies in transition, GDP effects range from negligible to a several percent
                     increase, reflecting opportunities for energy-efficiency improvements not available to Annex
                     II countries. Under assumptions of drastic energy-efficiency improvement and/or
                     continuing economic recessions in some countries, the assigned amounts may exceed
                     projected emissions in the first commitment period. In this case, models show increased
                     GDP due to revenues from trading assigned amounts. However, for some economies in
                     transition, implementing the Kyoto Protocol will have similar impact on GDP as for
                     Annex II countries.

           The above-referenced models report results for Energy Modeling Forum scenarios examining the benefits of
           emissions trading. For the analyses reported here, these models exclude sinks, multiple gases, ancillary benefits,
           macro-economic shocks, and induced technical change, but include lump sum tax revenue recycling. In the
           model baseline, additional no-regrets options, which are not listed above, are included.

      7.19       Emission constraints on Annex I countries have well-established, albeit varied,                                   WGIII TAR Sections 8.3.2

                  • Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries: Analyses report costs differently, including, inter alia,
                    reductions in projected GDP and reductions in projected oil revenues. The study reporting
                    the lowest costs shows reductions of 0.2% of projected GDP with no emissions trading, and
                    less than 0.05% of projected GDP with Annex B emissions trading in the year 2010.17

      16
           Spill-over effects incorporate only economic, not environmental, effects.
      17
           These estimated costs can be expressed as differences in GDP growth rates over the period 2000–2010. With no
           emissions trading, GDP growth rate is reduced by 0.02 percentage points per year; with Annex B emissions
           trading, growth rate is reduced by less than 0.005 percentage points per year.

 Synthesis Report                                                                                                        Question 7




            The study reporting the highest costs shows reductions of 25% of projected oil revenues
            with no emissions trading, and 13% of projected oil revenues with Annex B emissions
            trading in the year 2010 (see Table 7-3c). These studies do not consider policies and
            measures18 other than Annex B emissions trading, which could lessen the impact on
            non-Annex I, oil-exporting countries, and therefore tend to overstate both the costs to
            these countries and overall costs. The effects on these countries can be further reduced by
            removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, energy tax restructuring according to carbon content,
            increased use of natural gas, and diversification of the economies of non-Annex I, oil-
            exporting countries.
          • Other non-Annex I countries: They may be adversely affected by reductions in demand
            for their exports to OECD nations and by the price increase of those carbon-intensive
            and other products they continue to import. These countries may benefit from the reduction
            in fuel prices, increased exports of carbon-intensive products, and the transfer of
            environmentally sound technologies and know-how. The net balance for a given country
            depends on which of these factors dominates. Because of these complexities, the
            breakdown of winners and losers remains uncertain.
          • Carbon leakage: The possible relocation of some carbon-intensive industries to non-
            Annex I countries and wider impacts on trade flows in response to changing prices may
            lead to leakage on the order of 5-20%.19 Exemptions (e.g., for energy-intensive industries)
            make the higher model estimates for carbon leakage unlikely, but would raise aggregate
            costs. The transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, not included
            in models, may lead to lower leakage and especially on the longer term may more than
            offset the leakage.

7.20    Some sources of greenhouse gas emissions can be limited at no, or negative,                                              WGIII TAR Sections 5.3-5,
                                                                                                                                 7.3.3, 8.2.2, 8.2.4, 9.2.1-2,
        net social cost to the extent that policies can exploit no-regret opportunities.
                                                                                                                                 9.2.4, 9.2.8, & 10.4
        This may be achieved by removal of market imperfections, accounting for
        ancillary benefits (see Question 8), and recycling revenues to finance reductions
        in distortionary taxes (“double dividend”).
         • Market imperfections: Reduction of existing market or institutional failures and other
           barriers that impede adoption of cost-effective emission reduction measures can lower
           private costs compared to current practice. This can also reduce private costs overall.
         • Ancillary benefits: Climate change mitigation measures will have effects on other societal
           issues. For example, reducing carbon emissions in many cases will result in the simultaneous
           reduction in local and regional air pollution. It is likely that mitigation strategies will also
           affect transportation, agriculture, land-use practices, and waste management and will have
           an impact on other issues of social concern, such as employment, and energy security.
           However, not all of the effects will be positive; careful policy selection and design can better
           ensure positive effects and minimize negative impacts. In some cases, the magnitude of
           ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the mitigating measures,
           adding to the no-regret potential, although estimates are difficult to make and vary widely.
         • Double dividend: Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned permits) provide revenues to
           the government. If used to finance reductions in existing distortionary taxes (“revenue
           recycling”), these revenues reduce the economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas
           reductions. The magnitude of this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of
           tax cuts, labor market conditions, and method of recycling. Under some circumstances,
           it is possible that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of mitigation.

18
   These policies and measures include those for non-CO2 gases and non-energy sources of all gases; offsets from
   sinks; industry restructuring (e.g., from energy producer to supplier of energy services); use of OPEC’s market
   power; and actions (e.g., of Annex B Parties) related to funding, insurance, and the transfer of technology. In
   addition, the studies typically do not include the following policies and effects that can reduce the total cost of
   mitigation: the use of tax revenues to reduce tax burdens or finance other mitigation measures; environmental
   ancillary benefits of reductions in fossil-fuel use; and induced technical change from mitigation policies.
19
   Carbon leakage is defined here as the increase in emissions in non-Annex B countries due to implementation of
   reductions in Annex B, expressed as a percentage of Annex B reductions.

                 Potential, Barriers, Opportunities, Policies, and Costs of Stabilizing
                 Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Long Term

      7.21       Cost of stabilization depends on both the target and the emissions
                 pathway.

      7.22       There is no single path to a low-emission future, and countries and regions                                               WGIII TAR Sections 2.3.2,

                 will have to choose their own path. Most model results indicate that known
                                                                                                                                           & WGIII TAR Chapter 3
                 technological options20 could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO2                                                    Appendix
                 stabilization levels, such as 550 ppmv, 450 ppmv, or below over the next 100
                 years or more, but implementation would require associated socio-economic
                 and institutional changes. To achieve stabilization at these levels, the scenarios suggest
                 that a very significant reduction in world carbon emissions per unit of GDP from year 1990
                 levels will be necessary. For the crucial energy sector, almost all greenhouse gas mitigation
                 and concentration stabilization scenarios are characterized by the introduction of efficient
                 technologies for both energy use and supply, and of low- or no-carbon energy. However,
                 no single technology option will provide all of the emissions reductions needed for
                 stabilization. Reduction options in non-energy sources and non-CO2 greenhouse gases will
                 also provide significant potential for reducing emissions.

      7.23       The development and diffusion of new economically competitive and                                                         WGIII TAR Section 10.3.3
                 environmentally sound technology can substantially reduce the costs of
                 stabilizing concentrations at a given level. A substantial body of work has considered
                 the implication of technology development and diffusion on the cost of meeting alternative
                 stabilization levels. The principal conclusion is that the cost of emissions mitigation depends
                 crucially on the ability to develop and deploy new technology. The value of successful
                 technology diffusion appears to be large and depends upon the magnitude and timing of
                 emissions mitigation, the assumed reference scenario, and the economic competitiveness
                 of the technology.

      7.24       The pathway to stabilization can be as important as the stabilization level itself                                        WGIII TAR Sections 2.3.2,
                                                                                                                                           5.3.1, 8.4, & 10.4.2-3
                 in determining mitigation cost. Economic modeling studies completed since the SAR
                 indicate that a gradual near-term transition from the world’s present energy system towards
                 a less carbon-emitting economy minimizes costs associated with premature retirement of
                 existing capital stock. It also provides time for investment in technology development and
                 diffusion, and may reduce the risk of lock-in to early versions of rapidly developing low-
                 emission technology. On the other hand, more rapid near-term action would increase
                 flexibility in moving towards stabilization, decrease environmental and human risks
                 associated with rapid climatic changes, while minimizing potential implications of inertia
                 in climate and ecological systems (see Question 5). It may also stimulate more rapid
                 deployment of existing low-emission technologies and provide strong near-term incentives
                 to future technological changes that may help reduce the risks of lock-in to carbon-intensive
                 technologies. It also would give greater scope for later tightening of targets should that be

           increase in costs passing from 550 to 450 ppmv (see Figure 7-3) unless the emissions in the
           baseline scenario are very low (see Figure 7-4). Although model projections indicate long-
           term global growth paths of GDP are not significantly affected by mitigation actions towards
           stabilization, these do not show the larger variations that occur over some shorter time periods,
           sectors, or regions. These results, however, do not incorporate carbon sequestration, and did
           not examine the possible effect of more ambitious targets on induced technological change.
           Costs associated with each concentration level depend on numerous factors including the rate
           of discount, distribution of emission reductions over time, policies and measures employed,
           and particularly the choice of the baseline scenario. For scenarios characterized by a focus
           on local and regional sustainable development for example, total costs of stabilizing at a
           particular level are significantly lower than for other scenarios. Also, the issue of uncertainty
           takes on increasing importance as the time frame is expanded.

                  emissions during the 21st century (see Figure 7-5). The carbon in proven conventional oil
                  and gas reserves is much less than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with
                  stabilization of CO2 at levels of 450 ppmv or higher.21 These resource data may imply a
                  change in the energy mix and the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st
                  century. The choice of energy mix and associated technologies and investments—either
                  more in the direction of exploitation of unconventional oil and gas resources, or in the
                  direction of non-fossil energy sources or fossil energy technology with carbon capture and
                  storage—will determine whether, and if so, at what level and cost, greenhouse concentrations
                  can be stabilized.

                  Energy-related R&D expenditure by Annex II governments increased dramatically after
                  the 1970 oil price increases, but as a group it has decreased steadily in real terms since the
                  early 1980s. In some countries the decrease has been as great as 75%. The support for energy
                  conservation and renewable energy R&D has increased. However, other important energy
                  technologies relevant to climate change, such as, for example, commercial biomass and
                  carbon capture and storage, remain minor constituents of the energy R&D portfolio.

                  contribute to climate change mitigation. Changes in collective rules and individual
                  behaviors may have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, but take place within a
                  complex institutional, regulatory, and legal setting. Several studies suggest that current incentive
                  systems can encourage resource-intensive production and consumption patterns that increase
                  greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors (e.g., transport and housing). In the shorter term, there
                  are opportunities to influence through social innovations individual and organizational behaviors.

         In the longer term, such innovations in combination with technological change may further
         enhance socio-economic potential, particularly if preferences and cultural norms shift towards
         lower emitting and sustainable behaviors. These innovations frequently meet with resistance,
         which may be addressed by encouraging greater public participation in the decision-making
         process. This can help contribute to new approaches to sustainability and equity.

         Integrating Near- and Long-Term Considerations

7.30     Climate change decision making is a sequential process under
         uncertainty. Decision making at any point in time entails balancing
         the risks of either insufficient or excessive action.

7.31     Development of a prudent risk management strategy involves careful                                            WGIII TAR Section 10.4.3

              and society’s responses to them is likely to be great. Decisions about near-term climate
              policies are in the process of being made while the concentration stabilization target is still
              being debated. The literature suggests a step-by-step resolution aimed at stabilizing greenhouse
              gas concentrations. This will also involve balancing the risks of either insufficient or excessive
              action. The relevant question is not “what is the best course for the next 100 years,” but
              rather “what is the best course for the near term given the expected long-term climate
              change and accompanying uncertainties.”

              scenario analyses suggest that achievement of stabilization at 450 ppmv may require emission
              reductions during the period 2008 to 2012 in Annex I countries that are significantly stronger
              than the Kyoto Protocol commitments. This analysis also suggests that achieving the
              aggregate Kyoto commitments may be consistent with trajectories that achieve stabilization
              at 550 ppmv or higher. Other analyses suggest a more gradual departure from emissions
              baselines even for 450 ppmv followed by sharper reductions in subsequent budget periods.
              The path is influenced by the representation of inertia in the system and expectations about
              how initial reductions by Annex I countries may relate to the strength and scope of emissions
              limitation in subsequent periods.

      7.33    Climate change mitigation raises both inter-regional and inter-
              temporal equity considerations.

              differences in mitigation costs, are often key considerations in the analysis
              of climate change mitigation options. Much of the debate about the future differentiation
              of contributions of countries to mitigation and related equity issues also considers these
              circumstances.22 The challenge of addressing climate change raises an important issue of
              equity, namely the extent to which the impacts of climate change or mitigation policies
              ameliorate or exacerbate inequities both within and across nations and regions, and between
              generations. Findings with respect to these different aspects of equity include:
               • Equity within nations: Most studies show that the distributional effects of a carbon tax
                  are regressive unless the tax revenues are used either directly or indirectly in favor of
                  the low-income groups; the regressive aspect can be totally or partially compensated
                  by a revenue-recycling policy.
               • Equity across nations and regions: Greenhouse gas stabilization scenarios assessed in
                  this report assume that developed countries and countries with economies in transition
                  limit and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions first.23 Another aspect of equity across
                  nations and regions is that mitigation of climate change can offset inequities that would
                  be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change (see Question 6).
               • Equity between generations: Stabilization of concentrations depends more upon cumulative
                  than annual emissions; emissions reductions by any generation will reduce the need for
                  those by future generations.24 Inter-generational equity can be promoted by reducing climate
                  change impacts through mitigation of climate change by any generation, since not only
                  would impacts—which are expected to affect especially those with the fewest resources—
                  be reduced, but also subsequent generations will have less climate change to adapt to
                  (see Question 6).

      22
         Approaches to equity have been classified into a variety of categories, including those based on allocation,
         outcome, process, rights, liability, poverty, and opportunity, reflecting the diverse expectations of fairness used
         to judge policy processes and the corresponding outcomes.
      23
         Emissions from all regions diverge from baselines at some point. Global emissions diverge earlier and to a greater
         extent as stabilization levels are lower or underlying scenarios are higher. Such scenarios are uncertain, and do not
         provide information on equity implications and how such changes may be achieved or who may bear any costs incurred.

      8.1   The answer to this question recognizes two major points. The first is that the human impacts on
            the environment are manifested in several issues, many driven by common factors associated
            with the meeting of human needs. The second is that many of these issues—their causes
            and impacts—are biogeophysically and socio-economically interrelated. With a central
            emphasis on climate change, this answer assesses the current understanding of the interrelations
            between the causes and impacts of the key environmental issues of today. To that is added
            a summary of the now largely separate policy approaches to these issues. In so doing, this
            answer frames how choices associated with one issue may positively or negatively influence
            another. With such knowledge, there is the prospect of efficient integrated approaches.

      8.2   Local, regional, and global environmental issues often combine in
            ways that jointly affect the sustainable meeting of human needs.

      8.3   Meeting human needs is degrading the environment in many instances, and                                           WGI TAR Sections 3.4, 4.1,

            has a range of socio-economic paths to development; however, these will only be sustainable                       Sections 3.6 & 4.2
            if due consideration is given to the environment. Environmental degradation is already evident
            at the local, regional, and global scale, such as air pollution, scarcity of freshwater, deforestation,
            desertification, acid deposition, loss of biological diversity and changes at the genetic and
            species level, land degradation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change. Very
            frequently, addressing human needs causes or exacerbates several environmental problems,
            which may increase the vulnerability to climatic changes. For example, with the aim of higher
            agricultural production, there is increased use of nitrogeneous fertilizers, irrigation, and
            conversion of forested areas to croplands. These agricultural activities can affect the Earth’s
            climate through release of greenhouse gases, degrade land by erosion and salinization, and
            reduce biodiversity. In turn, an environmental change can impact meeting human needs. For
            example, agricultural productivity can be adversely affected by changes in the magnitude and
            pattern of rainfall, and human health in an urban environment can be impacted by heat waves.

      8.4   Just as different environmental problems are often caused by the same                                             WGIII TAR Chapter 5,

            life-style patterns, demographic shifts (population size, age structure, and
            migration), and governance structures), common barriers inhibit solutions to
            a variety of environmental and socio-economic issues. Approaches to the amelioration
            of environmental issues can be hampered by many of the same barriers, for example:
              • Increased demand for natural resources and energy
              • Market imperfections, including subsidies that lead to the inefficient use of resources
                and act as a barrier to the market penetration of environmentally sound technologies;
                the lack of recognition of the true value of natural resources; failure to appropriate for
                the global values of natural resources at the local level; and failure to internalize the
                costs of environmental degradation into the market price of a resource
              • Limited availability and transfer of technology, inefficient use of technologies, and
                inadequate investment in research and development for the technologies of the future
              • Failure to manage adequately the use of natural resources and energy.

      8.5   Several environmental issues that traditionally have been viewed
            as separate are indeed linked with climate change via common
            biogeochemical and socio-economic processes.

      8.6   Figure 8-1 illustrates how climate change is interlinked with several other environmental issues.

Figure 8-1: Climate is controlled by geochemical processes and cycles resulting from the interplay among the environment’s components
involved, as affected by human action. The scheme shows some of these issues. For simplicity, the single double-ended arrows between issues
represent some of the linkages involved. For example, biological and ecological processes play an important role in modulating the Earth’s
climate at both regional and global scale by controlling the amounts of water vapor and other greenhouse gases that enter into or are depleted
from the atmosphere. Changes in climate affect the boundaries, composition, and functioning of ecological systems, such as forests, and changes
in the structure and functioning of forests affect the Earth’s climate system through changes in the biogeochemical cycles, particularly cycles
of carbon, nitrogen, and water. There are other linkages such as the connection between air quality and forestry, directly or through acid precipitation, which
for simplicity are not shown here.



         ozone pollution (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds) also
         contribute to the rise in global tropospheric ozone, making it the third most important
         contributor to radiative forcing after CO2 and CH4 (see Figure 2-2). In some regions
         emissions of ozone precursor substances are controlled by regional environmental treaties
         (see Table 8-3) and other regulations.

         and the occurrence of major pollution episodes. While warmer temperatures would generally

             change (e.g., through increase in humidity and temperature). Actions to reduce sulfur
             emissions have been taken in many countries, and declines in sulfate deposition have been
             observed in some regions in recent years (see Table 8-3). In the SRES scenarios, this
             situation has led to projections of future sulfate aerosol abundances that are lower than
             those in the SAR. This has led, in turn, to less negative projections for the radiative forcing
             by aerosols, hence less of a cooling effect to offset the greenhouse gas-induced warming.

             Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Climate Change

      8.10   Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer leads to an increased penetration                              WGI TAR Sections 4.2.2 &
                                                                                                                       6.4
             of UV-B radiation and to a cooling of the climate system. Ozone depletion has
             allowed for increased penetration of UV-B radiation, with harmful effects on human and
             animal health, plants, etc. During the last 2 decades, the observed losses of stratospheric
             ozone have decreased the downward infrared emissions to the troposphere from the (now
             colder) lower stratosphere. Stratospheric ozone depletion has also altered tropospheric ozone
             concentrations, and, by allowing more ultraviolet sunlight into the troposphere, it has led
             to more rapid photochemical destruction of CH4 thereby reducing its radiative forcing.
             These effects lead also to a cooling of the climate system.

      8.11   Many of the halocarbons that cause depletion of the ozone layer are also important                        WGI TAR Sections 4.2.2 &
                                                                                                                       6.3.3
             greenhouse gases. Chlorofluorocarbons, for example, add a notable fraction to the
             total positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial era. The negative radiative forcing
             from the associated stratospheric ozone depletion (noted above) reduces this by about half.
             The Montreal Protocol will eventually eliminate both of these radiative-forcing contributions.
             However, one class of substitutes for the now-banned chlorofluorocarbons is hydrofluorocarbons,
             which are among the greenhouse gases listed under the Kyoto Protocol. This overlap can give
             rise to a potential conflict beween the goals of the two Protocols.

      8.12   Climate change will alter the temperature and wind patterns of the stratosphere,                          WGI TAR Sections 4.5, 6.4,
                                                                                                                       & 7.2.4.2
             possibly enhancing chlorofluorocarbon depletion of stratospheric ozone over
             the next 50 years. Increases in greenhouse gases lead in general to a colder stratosphere,
             which alters stratospheric chemistry. Some studies predict that current rates of climate change
             will result in significant increases in the depletion of the Arctic stratospheric ozone layer
             over the next decade before chlorofluorocarbon concentrations have declined substantially.
             Although many climate/ozone-layer feedbacks have been identified, no quantitative consensus
             is reached in this assessment.

             Biodiversity, Agriculture and Forestry, and Climate Change

      8.13   Changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are closely linked to changes                                WGI TAR Section 4.5.3
             in climate and vice versa. Changes in climate and in atmospheric concentrations of CO2
             cause changes in the biodiversity and function of some ecosystems. In turn, ecosystem changes
             influence the land-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, and N2O)
             and of water and energy, and change surface albedo. Therefore, understanding these combined
             effects and feedbacks are a requisite for evaluating the future state of the atmosphere and
             the natural systems and their biodiversity.

8.14   Natural climate variations have illustrated the impacts of climate change on                                WGII TAR Chapters 5 & 6
       natural and managed ecosystems. The impacts of floods, droughts, and heat waves
       are etched into human history. Further, the warming events associated with El Niño illustrate
       that changes in climate patterns adversely affect fish, marine mammals, and coastal and
       ocean biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems—such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangrove
       forests—are affected by sea-level rise, warming ocean temperatures, increased CO2
       concentrations, and changes in storm frequency and intensity. Table 8-1 gives main
       implications of climate change for natural ecosystems at the regional scale.

8.15   Climate change is but one of many stresses on managed and unmanaged                                         WGII TAR Chapters 5 & 6,
                                                                                                                   & WGIII TAR Sections 4.1-2
       ecosystems. Land-use change, resource demands, deposition of nutrients and pollutants,
       harvesting, grazing, habitat fragmentation and loss, and invasive species are major stressors
       on ecosystems. They can lead to species extinction, resulting in losses of biodiversity.
       Therefore, climate change constitutes an additional stress and could change or endanger
       ecosystems and the many services they provide. As a result, the impact of climate change
       will be influenced by management of natural resources, adaptation, and interaction with
       other pressures. Figure 8-2 exemplifies the manner in which climate change interacts with
       other factors in food supply and demand.

8.16   Climate change can influence the distribution and migration of species in                                   WGII TAR Chapter 5
       unmanaged ecosystems. Populations of many species are already threatened with
       extinction and are expected to be placed at greater risk by the stresses of changing climate,
       rendering portions of their current habitat unsuitable. Vegetation distribution models since
       the SAR suggest that a mass ecosystem or biome movement is most unlikely to occur
       because differerent species have different climate tolerance and different migration abilities,
       and are affected differently by the arrival of new species. Lastly, in a related sense, climate
       change can enhance the spreading of pests and diseases, thereby affecting both natural
       ecosystems, crops, and livestock (e.g., changes in temperature and humidity thresholds
       allow pests and diseases to move to new areas).

8.17   Carbon storage capacities of managed and unmanaged ecosystems,                                              WGIII TAR Section 4.3 &

       particularly forests, influence impacts and feedbacks with climate change.
       For example, forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems offer a significant
       carbon mitigation potential. Although not necessarily permanent, conservation and
       sequestration may allow time for other options to be further developed and implemented.
       Terrestrial ecosystem degradation may be exacerbated by climate change, affecting the
       storage of carbon, and adding to the stresses resulting from the current deforestation
       practices. It should be noted that, if appropriate management practices are not carried out,
       CO2 emissions in the future could be higher. For example, abandoning fire management in
       forests or reverting from direct seeding to intensive tillage in agriculture may result in
       rapid loss of part, at least, of the accumulated carbon.

       in many areas. Land-use conversion and the intensive use of land, particularly in the world’s               Table SPM-1
       arid and semi-arid regions, has resulted in decreased soil fertility and increased land
       degradation and desertification. The changes have been large enough to be apparent from
       satellite images. Land degradation already affects more than 900 million people in 100
       countries, and one quarter of the world soil resources, most of them in the developing countries.
       The annual recorded losses of millions of hectares significantly undermine economies and
       create some irreversible situations. The TAR projections using the SRES scenarios indicate
       increased droughts, higher intensity of rainfall, more irregular rainfall patterns, and more
       frequent tropical summer drought in the mid-latitude continental interiors. The systems that

                                                        loss of biodiversity, as ecosystems are converted to fields growing
                                                        only a few species (usually exotics). Change of forests to agriculture
                                                        brings a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, as forests are
                                                        replaced by grassland or cropland. This clearing also increases
                                                        flooding probability, as the agricultural systems retain less
                                                        precipitation than forests. Intensification of crop production can
                                                        involve a variety of chemical treatments, most of them being nitrogen

                                                        environmental and health implications. The expansion of irrigation
                                                        affects the supply of freshwater for other uses, leading to
                                                        shortages and conflicts over water-use rights. Meeting the needs
                                                        for increased agricultural production has the potential to increase

              dirty water—may be exacerbated by climate change. Freshwater is essential for
              human health, food production, and sanitation, as well as for manufacturing and other industrial
              uses and sustaining ecosystems. There are several indicators of water resources stress. When
              withdrawals are greater than 20% of the total renewable resources, water stress often is a
              limiting factor on development. Withdrawals of 40% or more represent high stress. Similarly,
              water stress may be a problem if a country or region has less than 1,700 m3 yr−1 of water per
              capita. In the year 1990, approximately one-third of the world’s population lived in countries
              using more than 20% of their water resources, and by the year 2025 about 60% of a larger
              total would be living in such a stressed country, only because of population growth. Higher
              temperatures could increase such stress conditions. However, adaptation through appropriate
              water management practices can reduce the adverse impacts. While climate change is just
              one of the stresses on water resources in this increasingly populated world, it is clear that it
              is an important one (see Table 8-2). The TAR projections using the SRES scenarios of future

       climate indicate a tendency for increased flood and drought risks for many areas under most
       scenarios. Decreases of water availability in parts of a warmer world are projected in areas
       like southern Africa and countries around the Mediterranean. Because of sea-level rise,
       many coastal systems will experience saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater and
       encroachment of tidal water into estuaries and river systems, with consequential effects on
       freshwater availability.

8.20   Water managers in some countries are beginning to consider climate change                                     WGII TAR Section 4.2.4
       explicitly, although methodologies for doing so are not yet well defined. By its
       nature, water management is based around minimization of risks and adaptation to changing
       circumstances, now also changing climate. There has been a gradual shift from “supply-
       side” approaches (i.e., providing water to satisfy demands by increased capacity reservoirs
       or structural flood defenses) towards “demand-side” approaches (i.e., trimming demands
       adequately to match water availability, using water more efficiently, and non-structural
       means of preparedness to floods and droughts).

8.21   Interactions between climate change and other environmental
       problems offer opportunities to capture synergies in developing
       response options, enhancing benefits, and reducing costs (see
       Figure 1-1).

8.22   By capturing synergies, some greenhouse gas mitigation actions may yield                                      WGIII TAR Sections 3.6.4,
       extensive ancillary benefits for several other environmental problems, but also                               4.4, 8.2.4, & 9.2.2-5

       trade-offs may occur. Examples include, inter alia, reduction of negative environmental
       impacts such as air pollution and acid deposition; protecting forests, soils, and watersheds;
       reducing distortionary subsidies and taxes; and inducing more efficient technological change
       and diffusion, contributing to wider goals of sustainable development. However, dependent
       on the way climate change or other environmental problems are addressed, and the degree
       to which interlinking issues are taken into account, significant trade-offs may occur and
       unanticipated costs may be incurred. For example, policy options to reduce greenhouse
       gas emissions from the energy and land-use sectors can have both positive and negative
       effects on other environmental problems:
         • In the energy sector, greenhouse gas emissions as well as local and regional pollutants
           could be reduced through more efficient and environmentally sound use of energy and
           increasing the share of lower carbon emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil-fuel
           technologies (e.g., highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines, fuel cells, and combined
           heat and power), and renewable energy technologies (e.g., increased use of environmentally
           sound biofuels, hydropower, solar, wind- and wave-power). Increased use of biomass
           as a substitute for fossil fuel could have positive or negative impacts on soils, biodiversity,
           and water availability depending on the land use it replaces and the management regime.
         • In the land-use sector, conservation of biological carbon pools not only prevents carbon
           from being emitted into the atmosphere, it also can have a favorable effect on soil
           productivity, prevent biodiversity loss, and reduce air pollution problems from biomass
           burning. Carbon sequestration by plantation forestry can enhance carbon sinks and
           protect soils and watersheds, but—if developed improperly—may have negative effects
           on biodiversity and water availability. For example, in some implementations, monoculture
           plantations could decrease local biodiversity.

8.23   Conversely, addressing environmental problems other than climate change                                       WGIII TAR Sections 2.4,
                                                                                                                     9.2.8, & 10.3.2, & SRES
       can have ancillary climate benefits, but the linkages between the various
       problems may also lead to trade-offs. Examples include:
        • There are likely to be substantial greenhouse gas benefits from policies aimed at reducing
          air pollution. For example, increasing pollution is often associated with the rapidly
          growing transportation sector in all regions, involving emissions of particulate matter
          and precursors of ozone pollution. Addressing these emissions to reduce the impacts

                on human health, agriculture, and forestry through increasing energy efficiency or
                penetration of non-fossil-fuel energy can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
              • Controlling sulfur emissions has positive impacts on human health and vegetation, but
                sulfate aerosols partly offset the warming effect of greenhouse gases and therefore
                control of sulfur emissions can amplify possible climate change. If sulfur emissions are
                controlled through desulfurization of flue gases at power plants, an energy penalty
                results, with associated increase of greenhouse gas emissions.

      8.24   Adopting environmentally sound technologies and practices offer particular                                    WGII TAR Section 7.5.4 &
             opportunities for economically, environmentally, and socially sound development                               WGIII TAR Section 10.3.2

             while avoiding greenhouse gas-intensive activities. For example, the application
             of supply- and demand-side energy-efficient technologies simultaneously reduces various
             energy-related environmental impacts and can lower the pressure on energy investments,
             reduce public investments, improve export competitiveness, and enlarge energy reserves.
             The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices (e.g., in Africa) illustrates the mutually
             reinforcing effects of climate change mitigation, environmental protection, and long-term
             economic benefits. The introduction or expansion of agroforestry and balanced fertilizer
             agriculture can improve food security and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
             More decentralized development patterns based on a stronger role for small- and medium-
             sized cities can decrease the migration of rural population into urban centers, reduce needs
             for transportation, and allow the use of environmentally sound technologies (bio-fuel, solar
             energy, wind, and small-scale hydropower) to tap the large reserves of natural resources.

      8.25   Reducing vulnerability to climate change can often reduce vulnerability to                                    WGII TAR Sections 4.1-2
                                                                                                                           & 7.5.4
             other environmental stresses and vice versa. Examples include, inter alia:
              • Protecting threatened ecosystems: Removing societal stresses and managing resources
                in a sustainable manner may help unique and threatened systems also to cope with the
                additional stress posed by climate change. Accounting for potential climatic changes
                and integration with socio-economic needs and development plans can make biodiversity
                conservation strategies and climate change adaptation measures more effective.
              • Land-use management: Addressing or avoiding land degradation also decreases
                vulnerability to climate change, especially when response strategies consider the social
                and economic factors defining the land-use practices together with the additional risks
                imposed by climate change. In regions where deforestation is progressing and leading
                to carbon loss and increased peak runoff, restoring vegetation by reforestation (and
                when possible by afforestation) and revegetation can help to combat desertification.
              • Freshwater management: Problems with availability, abundance, and pollution of
                freshwater, which are often caused by demographic and development pressures, can be
                exacerbated by climate change. Reducing vulnerability to water stress (e.g., by water
                conservation, water-demand management, and more efficient water use) also reduces
                vulnerability to additional stress by climate change.

      8.26   Approaches that exploit synergies between environmental policies and key                                      WGIII TAR Sections 1.3.4,
                                                                                                                           2.2.3, & 10.3.2, & DES GP
             national socio-economic objectives like growth and equity could help mitigate
             and reduce vulnerability to climate change, as well as promote sustainable
             development. Sustainable development is closely linked with the environmental, social,
             and economic components defining the status of each community. The interconnections
             among those elements of sustainable development are reflected in Figure 8-3, illustrating
             that important issues such as climate change, sustainability, poverty, and equity can be
             related to all three components. Just as climate policies can yield ancillary benefits that improve
             well-being, non-climate socio-economic policies may bring climate benefits. Utilizing such
             ancillary benefits would aid in making development more sustainable. Complex interactions
             among environmental, social, and economic challenges exist, and therefore none of these
             three types of problems can be resolved in isolation.

        and inequitable empowerment and access to resources are not only highly
        vulnerable to climate change but also to other environmental problems, and
        at the same time have limited capacity to adapt to these changing circumstances
        and/or mitigate them. The capacity of these countries to adapt and mitigate can be
        enhanced when climate policies are integrated with non-climate objectives of national policy
        development and turned into broad transition strategies to achieve the long-term social and
        technological changes required by both sustainable development and climate change
        mitigation.

8.28    A great deal of interaction exists among the environmental issues that multilateral                                                    WGIII TAR Section 10.3.2
        environmental agreements address, and synergies can be exploited in their
        implementation. Global environmental problems are addressed in a range of individual
        conventions and agreements—the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol, the United
        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United Nations Convention on
        Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and the
        United Nations Forum on Forests—as well as a range of regional agreements, such as the
        Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. Table 8-3 provides a list of
        selected examples of such conventions and instruments. They may contain, inter alia, similar
        requirements concerning common shared or coordinated governmental and civil institutions
        to enact the general objectives—for example, formulation of strategies and action plans as
        a framework for country-level implementation; collection of data and processing information
        and new and strengthened capacities for both human resources and institutional structures;
        and reporting obligations. Also they provide a framework within which synergies in scientific
        assessment can be utilized (see Box 8-1).

             Introduction

      9.1    The understanding of climate change, its impacts, and the options to mitigate
             and adapt is developed through multi- and interdisciplinary research and
             monitoring in an integrated assessment framework. As understanding deepens,
             some findings become more robust and some uncertainties emerge as critical for informed
             policy formulation. Some uncertainties arise from a lack of data and a lack of understanding
             of key processes and from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. Other
             uncertainties are associated with predicting social and personal behavior in response to
             information and events. The uncertainties tend to escalate with the complexity of the problem,
             as additional elements are introduced to include a more comprehensive range of physical,
             technical, social, and political impacts and policy responses. The climate responds to human
             influence without deliberation or choice; but human society can respond to climate change
             deliberately, making choices between different options. An objective of the TAR and other
             IPCC reports is to explore, assess, quantify, and, if possible, reduce these uncertainties.

      9.2    In this report, a robust finding for climate change is defined as one that holds
             under a variety of approaches, methods, models, and assumptions and one
             that is expected to be relatively unaffected by uncertainties. A robust finding
             can be expected to fall into the categories of well-established (high level of agreement and
             high amount of evidence) and established but incomplete (high level of agreement, but
             incomplete evidence) in the literature. Robustness is different from likelihood: A finding
             that an outcome is “exceptionally unlikely” may be just as robust as the finding that it is
             “virtually certain.” A major development in the TAR is that of the multiple alternative
             pathways for emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases as represented by the SRES.
             Robust findings are those that are maintained under a wide range of these possible worlds.

      9.3    Key uncertainties in this context are those which, if reduced, may lead to new
             and robust findings in relation to the questions of this report. These findings
             may, in turn, lead to better or more of the information that underpins policy making. The
             uncertainties can never be fully resolved, but often they can be bounded by more evidence
             and understanding, particularly in the search for consistent outcomes or robust conclusions.

      9.4    Robust findings and key uncertainties can be brought together
             in the context of an integrated assessment framework.

      9.5    The integrated assessment framework described in this report is used to bring
             together the robust findings and key uncertainties in the model projections.
             Such a framework can encompass all the disciplines involved in understanding the climate,
             the biosphere, and human society. It emphasizes the linkages between the systems described
             in the different Working Group reports of the TAR as well as considers linkages between
             climate change and other environmental issues, and helps to identify gaps in knowledge. It
             suggests how key uncertainties can affect the whole picture. Figure 1-1 shows how adaptation
             and mitigation can be integrated into the assessment. The human and natural systems will
             have to adapt to climate change, and development will be affected. The adaptation will be
             both autonomous and via government initiatives, and adaptation actions will reduce (but cannot
             entirely avoid) some of the impacts of climate change on these systems and on development.
             Adaptation actions provide benefits but also entail costs. Mitigation is unlike adaptation in
             that it reduces emissions at the start of the cycle, it reduces concentrations (compared to
             what would otherwise occur), and it reduces climate change and the risks and uncertainties
             associated with climate change. It further reduces the need for adaptation, the impacts of
             climate change, and effects on socio-economic development. It is also different in that mitigation
             aims to address the impacts on the climate system, whereas adaptation is primarily oriented
             to address localized impacts of climate change. The primary benefit of mitigation is avoided
             climate change, but it also has costs. In addition, mitigation gives rise to ancillary benefits

       (e.g., reduced air pollution leading to improvements in human health). A fully integrated approach
       to climate change assessment would consider the whole cycle shown in Figure 1-1 dynamically
       with all the feedbacks but this could not be accomplished in the TAR.

9.6    Many of the robust findings as listed in Table SPM-3 are concerned with the existence of
       a climate response to human activities and the sign of the response. Many of the key
       uncertainties are concerned with the quantification of the magnitude and/or the timing of
       the response and the potential effects of improving methods and relaxing assumptions.

       Attribution of Climate Change

9.7    There is now stronger evidence for a human influence on the global
       climate.

9.8    An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming                                     Q2.7 & Q2.10-11
       world and modeling studies indicate that most of the observed warming at
       the Earth’s surface over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to human
       activities. Globally, the 1990s were very likely to have been the warmest decade in the
       instrumental record (i.e., since the year 1861). For the Northern Hemisphere, the magnitude
       of the warming in the last 100 years is likely to be the largest of any century during the past
       1,000 years. Observations, together with model simulations, provide stronger evidence that
       most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to the increase in greenhouse
       gas concentrations. The observations also provide increased confidence in the ability of models
       to project future climate change. Better quantification of the human influence depends on
       reducing the key uncertainties relating to the magnitude and character of natural variability
       and the magnitude of climate forcings due to natural factors and anthropogenic aerosols
       (particularly indirect effects) and the relating of regional trends to anthropogenic climate change.

       Future Emissions and Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases and
       Aerosols

9.9    Human activities increase the atmospheric concentrations of
       greenhouse gases.

9.10   Since the year 1750 (i.e., the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), the                                    Q2.4, Q3.3, Q3.5, & Q5.3
       atmospheric concentration of CO2 (the largest contributor to anthropogenic
       radiative forcing) has increased by 31% due to human activities, and all SRES
       scenarios project substantial increases in the future (Figure 9-1a). Other
       greenhouse gases have also increased in concentrations since the year 1750 (e.g., CH4 by
       150%, N2O by 17%). The present CO2 concentration has not been exceeded during the
       past 420,000 years (the span measurable in ice cores) and likely not during the past 20
       million years. The rate of increase is unprecedented relative to any sustained global changes
       over at least the last 20,000 years. In projections of greenhouse gas concentrations based
       on the set of SRES scenarios (see Box 3-1), CO2 concentrations continue to grow to the
       year 2100. Most SRES scenarios show reductions in SO2 emissions (precursor for sulfate
       aerosols) by the year 2100 compared with the year 2000. Some greenhouse gases (e.g.,
       CO2, N2O, perfluorocarbons) have long lifetimes (a century or more) for their residence in
       the atmosphere, while the lifetime of aerosols is measured in days. Key uncertainties are
       inherent in the assumptions that underlie the wide range of future emissions in the SRES
       scenarios and therefore the quantification of future concentrations. These uncertainties
       relate to population growth, technological progress, economic growth, and governance
       structures, which are particularly difficult to quantify. Further, inadequate emission scenarios
       have been available of lower atmosphere ozone and aerosol precursors. Smaller uncertainties
       arise from lack of understanding of all the factors inherent in modeling the carbon cycle
       and including the effects of climate feedbacks. Accounting for all these uncertainties leads

               the year 2000).

      9.11     Fossil-fuel CO2 emissions are virtually certain to remain the dominant influence                               Q4.11 & Q7.4
               on the trends in CO2 concentrations over the 21st century. This is implied by the
               range of SRES scenarios in which projected fossil-fuel emissions exceed the foreseeable
               biospheric sources and sinks for CO2. It is estimated that, even if all the carbon so far released
               by land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., by reforestation),
               CO2 concentration would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm. There are key uncertainties in the
               influence of changing land use and biospheric feedbacks on the uptake, storage, and release
               of carbon that in turn could influence CO2 concentrations.

               Future Changes in Regional and Global Climate

      9.12     The climate has changed during the 20th century; larger changes
               are projected for the 21st century.

       more rapidly than the global average, particularly those at high northern latitudes in the

       hundreds of years even after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.
       This is due to the long time scales on which the deep ocean adjusts to climate change. Ice
       sheets will continue to react to climate change for thousands of years. Models project that
       a local warming (annually averaged) of larger than 3ºC, sustained for many millennia,
       would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea-
       level rise of about 7 m.

9.16   Key uncertainties that influence the quantification and the detail of future projections of                  Q3.6, Q3.9, & Q4.9-19
       climate change are those associated with the SRES scenarios, and also those associated with
       the modeling of climate change, in particular those that concern the understanding of key
       feedback processes in the climate system, especially those involving clouds, water vapor,
       and aerosols (including their indirect forcing). Allowing for these uncertainties leads to a range
       of projections of surface temperature increase for the period 1990 to 2100 of 1.4 to 5.8ºC
       (see Figure 9-1b) and of sea-level rise from 0.09 to 0.88 m. Another uncertainty concerns
       the understanding of the probability distribution associated with temperature and sea-level
       projections for the range of SRES scenarios. Key uncertainties also affect the detail of
       regional climate change and its impacts because of the limited capabilities of the regional
       models, and the global models driving them, and inconsistencies in results between different
       models especially in some areas and in precipitation. A further key uncertainty concerns
       the mechanisms, quantification, time scales, and likelihoods associated with large-scale
       abrupt/non-linear changes (e.g., ocean thermohaline circulation).

       Regional and Global Impacts of Climate Change

9.17   Projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects
       on both environmental and socio-economic systems, but the
       larger the changes and the rate of change in climate, the more
       the adverse effects predominate.

9.18   Regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, have already                             Q3.14 & Q3.18-21
       affected and will continue to affect a diverse set of physical and biological
       systems in many parts of the world. Examples of observed changes include shrinkage
       of glaciers, reductions in seasonal snow cover, thawing of permafrost, later freezing and earlier
       break-up of ice on rivers and lakes, loss of Arctic sea ice, lengthening of mid- to high-latitude
       growing seasons, poleward and altitudinal shifts of plant and animal ranges, changes in the
       seasonal progression of some plants and animals, declines in some plant and animal populations,
       and damage to coral reefs. These observed rates of change would be expected to increase

       increase with small increases in temperature. Plant productivity would decrease in most regions
       of the world for warming beyond a few ºC. In most tropical and subtropical regions, yields
       are projected to decrease for almost any increase in temperature.

9.19   Ecosystems and species are vulnerable to climate change and other stresses                                  Q3.18
       (as illustrated by observed impacts of recent regional temperature changes)
       and some will be irreversibly damaged or lost. Natural systems at risk include coral
       reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairie
       wetlands, and remnant native grasslands. While some species may increase in abundance
       or range, climate change will increase existing risks of extinction of some more vulnerable
       species and loss of biodiversity. It is well-established that the geographical extent of the
       damage or loss, and the number of systems affected, will increase with the magnitude and
       rate of climate change.

9.20   The adverse impacts of climate change are expected to fall disproportionately                               Q3.17, Q3.21-22, & Q3.33
       upon developing countries and the poor persons within countries. Projected
       changes in climate extremes could have major consequences especially on water and food
       security and on health. The vulnerability of human societies and natural systems to climate
       extremes is demonstrated by the damage, hardship, and death caused by events such as
       droughts, floods, heat waves, avalanches, landslides, and windstorms, which have shown
       an increasing trend during recent decades. While overall precipitation is projected to increase,
       there are likely to be much larger changes in intensity and frequency, which will increase
       the likelihood of extremes of drying and precipitation, and thus droughts and floods during
       the 21st century. These increases combined with increased water stress (occurring already because
       of increasing demand) will affect food security and health especially in many developing
       countries. Conversely, the frequency and magnitude of extreme low-temperature events, such
       as cold spells, is projected to decrease in the future, with both positive and negative impacts.

9.21   Populations that inhabit small islands and low-lying coastal areas are at                                   Q3.23-24
       particular risk of severe social and economic effects from sea-level rise and
       storm surges. Tens of millions of people living in deltas, low-lying coastal areas, and on
       small islands will face risk of displacement. Further negative impacts will be increased by
       saltwater intrusion and flooding due to storm surges and loss of coastal wetlands and slowing
       down of river discharges.

9.22   Key uncertainties in the identification and quantification of impacts arise from the lack of                Q3.13, Q4.10, & Q4.18-19
       reliable local or regional detail in climate change, especially in the projection of extremes,
       inadequate accounting in impacts assessments for the effects of changes in extremes and
       disasters, limited knowledge of some non-linear processes and feedbacks, uncertainties in
       the costing of the damage due to climate impacts, lack of both relevant data and understanding
       of key processes in different regions, and uncertainties in assessing and predicting the
       response of ecological and social (e.g., impact of vector- and water-borne diseases), and
       economic systems to the combined effect of climate change and other stresses such as
       land-use change, local pollution, etc.

       Costs and Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation Options

9.23   Adaptation is a necessity; its cost can be reduced by anticipation,
       analysis, and planning.

9.24   Adaptation is no longer an option, it is a necessity, given that climate changes                            Q3.26-28 & Q3.33
       and related impacts are already occurring. Anticipatory and reactive
       adaptation, which will vary with location and sector, has the potential to reduce
       adverse impacts of climate change, to enhance beneficial impacts, and to
       produce many immediate ancillary benefits, but will not prevent all damages.


                                                                                                                                              141
      Climate Change 2001                                                                                     Synthesis Report




             However, its potential is much more limited for natural systems than for human systems. The
             capacity of different regions to adapt to climate change depends highly upon their current
             and future states of socio-economic development and their exposure to climate stress.
             Therefore the potential for adaptation is more limited for developing countries, which are
             projected to be the most adversely affected. Adaptation appears to be easier if the climate
             changes are modest and/or gradual rather than large and/or abrupt. If climate changes more
             rapidly than expected in any region, especially with respect to climate extremes, then the
             potential of adaptation to diminish vulnerability of human systems will be lessened.

      9.25   The costs of adaptation can be reduced by anticipation and planned action,                               Q3.31 & Q3.36-37
             and many costs may be relatively small, especially when adaptation policies
             and measures contribute to other goals of sustainable development.

      9.26   Key uncertainties regarding adaptations relate to the inadequate representation by models                Q3.27
             of local changes, lack of foresight, inadequate knowledge of benefits and costs, possible side
             effects including acceptability and speed of implementation, various barriers to adaptation,
             and more limited opportunities and capacities for adaptation in developing countries.

      9.27   The primary economic benefits of mitigation are the avoided costs
             associated with the adverse impacts of climate change.

      9.28   Greenhouse gas emission reduction (mitigation) action would lessen the                                   Q6.10
             pressures on natural and human systems from climate change. Comprehensive,
             quantitative estimates of global primary benefits of mitigating climate change do not exist.
             For mean temperature increases over a few ºC relative to the year 1990, impacts are
             predominantly adverse, so net primary benefits of mitigation are positive. A key uncertainty
             is the net balance of adverse and beneficial impacts of climate change for temperature
             increases less than about a few ºC. These averages conceal wide regional variations.

      9.29   Mitigation generates costs and ancillary benefits.

      9.30   Major reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions would be necessary                                   Q6.4
             to achieve stabilization of their concentrations. For example, for the most important
             anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate that stabilization of atmospheric
             CO2 concentrations at 450, 650, or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO2
             emissions to drop below year 1990 levels within a few decades, about a century, or about
             2 centuries, respectively, and continue to decrease steadily thereafter. Emissions would
             peak in about 1 to 2 decades (450 ppm) and roughly a century (1,000 ppm) from the present.
             Eventually stabilization would require CO2 emissions to decline to a very small fraction of
             current global emissions. The key uncertainties here relate to the possibilities of climate
             change feedbacks and development pathways and how these affect the timing of emissions
             reductions.

      9.31   Mitigation costs and benefits vary widely across sectors, countries, and                                 Q7.14, Q7.17, & Q7.34
             development paths. In general, it is easier to identify sectors—such as coal, possibly oil
             and gas, and some energy-intensive industries dependent on energy produced from these
             fossil fuels—that are very likely to suffer an economic disadvantage from mitigation. Their
             economic losses are more immediate, more concentrated, and more certain. The sectors
             that are likely to benefit include renewable energy, services, and new industries whose
             development is stimulated by demand for low-emission fuels and production techniques.
             Different countries and development paths have widely different energy structures, so they
             too have different costs and benefits from mitigation. Carbon taxes can have negative income
             effects on low-income groups unless the tax revenues are used directly or indirectly to
             compensate such effects.

9.32    Emission constraints in Annex I countries have well established, albeit varied,                                       Q7.19
        “spill-over” effects on non-Annex I countries. Analyses of the effects of emissions
        constraints on Annex I countries report reductions below what would otherwise occur in
        both projected GDP and in projected oil revenues for oil-exporting non-Annex I countries.

9.33    Lower emissions scenarios require different patterns of energy resource                                               Q7.27
        development and an increase in energy R&D to assist accelerating the
        development and deployment of advanced environmentally sound energy
        technologies. Emissions of CO2 due to fossil-fuel burning are virtually certain to be to the
        dominant influence on the trend on the atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century.
        Resource data assessed in the TAR may imply a change in the energy mix and the introduction
        of new sources of energy during the 21st century. Fossil-fuel resources will not limit carbon
        emissions during the 21st century. The carbon in proven conventional oil and gas reserves is
        much less, however, than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with stabilization of CO2
        at levels of 450 ppm or higher.25 These resource data may imply a change in the energy mix
        and the introduction of new sources of energy during the 21st century. The choice of energy mix
        and associated technologies and investments—either more in the direction of exploitation of
        unconventional oil and gas resources, or in the direction of non-fossil energy sources, or fossil
        energy technology with carbon capture and storage—will determine whether, and if so, at what
        level and cost, greenhouse concentrations can be stabilized. Key uncertainties are the future relative
        prices of energy and carbon-based fuels, and the relative technical and economic attractiveness
        of non-fossil-fuel energy alternatives compared with unconventional oil and gas resources.

9.34    Significant progress in energy-saving and low-carbon technologies has been                                            Q7.3
        made since 1995, and the progress has been faster than anticipated in the
        SAR. Net emission reductions could be achieved through, inter alia, improved techniques
        in production and use of energy, shifts to low- or no-carbon technologies, CO2 removal and
        storage, improved land-use and forestry practices, and movement to more sustainable
        lifestyles. Significant progress is taking place in the development of wind turbines, solar
        energy, hybrid engine cars, fuel cells, and underground CO2 storage. Key uncertainties are
        (a) the likelihood of technological breakthroughs leading to substantial reductions in costs
        and rapid take-up of low-carbon processes and products, and (b) the future scale of private
        and public R&D expenditures on these technologies.

9.35    Studies examined in the TAR suggest substantial technological and other                                               Q7.6-7, Q7.14-15, Q7.20,

        opportunities for lowering mitigation costs. National mitigation responses
        to climate change can be more effective if deployed as a portfolio of policy
        instruments to limit or reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. The costs of
        mitigation are strongly affected by development paths, with those paths involving substantial
        increases in greenhouse gas emissions requiring more mitigation to reach a stabilization target,
        and hence higher costs. These costs can be substantially reduced or even turned into net
        benefits with a portfolio of policy instruments (including those that help to overcome barriers)
        to the extent that policies can exploit “no-regrets” opportunities in the following areas:
          • Technological options: Technological options may achieve global emissions reductions
            of 1.9 to 2.6 Gt Ceq yr−1 by year 2010 and 3.6 to 5.0 Gt Ceq yr−1 by year 2020. Half of these
            reductions may be realized with one component of their economic cost (net capital, operating,
            and maintenance costs) with direct benefits exceeding direct costs, and the other half
            with that component of their economic cost ranging from US$0 to US$100 per t Ceq.26
            Depending on the emissions scenario, global emissions could be reduced below year
            2000 levels over the 2010 to 2020 time frame. Key uncertainties are the identification,

25
   The reference to a particular concentration level does not imply an agreed-upon desirability of stabilization at
   this level.

   These cost estimates in 1998 prices are derived using discount rates in the range of 5 to 12%, consistent with
   public-sector discount rates. Private internal rates of return vary greatly and are often significantly higher.

                  extent, and nature of any barriers that impede adoption of promising low-emission
                  technologies, and the estimation of the costs of overcoming the barriers.
                • Ancillary benefits: Depending on factors (such as location of the greenhouse gas emissions,
                  the prevailing local climate, and the population density, composition, and health) the
                  magnitude of the ancillary benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of the
                  mitigating policies and measures. Key uncertainties are the magnitude and location of
                  these benefits involving the scientific assessment and valuation of health risks of air
                  pollution, particularly those involving fine aerosols and particles.
                • Double dividends: Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned permits) provide revenues
                  to the government. If used to finance reductions in existing distortionary taxes (“revenue
                  recycling”), these revenues reduce the economic cost of achieving greenhouse gas reductions.
                  The magnitude of this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of tax cuts,
                  labor market conditions, and method of recycling. Under some circumstances, it is possible
                  that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of mitigation. Key uncertainties regarding
                  the overall net costs of mitigation vary between countries, depending on the existing
                  tax structure, the extent of the distortion, and the type of tax cuts that are acceptable.

      9.36    Modeling studies show that emissions trading reduces costs of mitigation                                                    Q7.18-19
              for those participating in the trading. Global modeling studies, with results depending
              strongly upon assumptions, project that costs of mitigation based on Kyoto targets are
              likely to be reduced by full carbon-permit trading within the Annex B27 group of countries.
              Annex I OECD28 countries may expect aggregate costs to be reduced by about half through
              full permit trading. Annex I economies in transition are projected to be unaffected or to
              gain several percent increase in GDP. Oil-exporting, non-Annex I countries may also expect
              similar reductions in costs under such trading. The aggregate effects of trading are expected
              to be positive for other non-Annex I countries. Those countries that may expect a loss or
              gain without Annex I trading may expect a smaller change with trading. A key uncertainty
              is the extent of the underlying costs, which vary widely across countries, and how these
              cost estimates will be changed (a) when methods are improved and (b) when some of the
              assumptions of the models are relaxed. Such assumptions are concerned with:
                • Allowance for exemptions in the emission-permit trading in concert with other policies
                  and measures
                • Consideration of various market imperfections
                • Allowance for induced technical change
                • Inclusion of ancillary benefits
                • Opportunities for double dividends
                • Inclusion of policies for non-CO2 greenhouse gases and non-energy sources of all
                  greenhouse gases (e.g., CH4 from agriculture)
                • Offsets from sinks.

      9.37    Although model projections indicate that long-term global growth paths of                                                   Q7.25
              GDP are not significantly affected by mitigation actions towards stabilization,
              these do not show the larger variations that occur over some shorter time
              periods, sectors, or regions.

      9.38    Unexpected public policies (“quick fixes”) with sudden short-term effects may                                               Q7.24 & Q7.31
              cost economies much more than expected policies with gradual effects. A
              key uncertainty in the magnitude of the costs lies in the existence of well-designed
              contingency plans in the event of policy shifts (e.g., as a result of a sudden shift in public

144    IPCC Third Assessment Report
 Synthesis Report                                                                                         Question 9




       perception of the climate change). Other key uncertainties for costs lie in the possibilities
       of the rapid short-term effects including, or leading to, abrupt reductions in costs of low-
       carbon processes and products, shifts towards low-emission technologies, and/or changes
       towards more sustainable lifestyles.

9.39   Near-term action in mitigation and adaptation would reduce risks. Because of                               Q5.19 & Q5.24
       the long time lags associated both with the climate system (e.g., ~100 years for atmospheric
       CO2) and with human response, near-term action in mitigation and adaptation would reduce
       risks. Inertia in the interacting climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems is a major
       reason why anticipatory adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial.

9.40   Adaptation can complement mitigation in a cost-effective strategy to reduce                                Q1.9 & Q8.21-28
       climate change risks; together they can contribute to sustainable development
       objectives. Some future paths that focus on the social, economic, and environmental
       elements of sustainable development may result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than
       other paths, so that the level of additional policies and measures required for a particular
       level of stabilization and any associated costs can also be lower. A key uncertainty is the
       lack of appropriate knowledge on the interactions between climate change and other
       environmental issues and the related socio-economic implications. A related issue is the
       pace of change in integrating the main global conventions and protocols associated with
       climate change (e.g., those involving world trade, transboundary pollution, biodiversity,
       desertification, stratospheric ozone depletion, health, and food security). It is also uncertain
       at which rate individual countries will integrate sustainable development concepts into
       policy-making processes.

9.41   Development paths that meet sustainable development objectives may result                                  Q5.22, Q7.25, & Q8.26
       in lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Key choices about future development
       paths and the future of the climate are being made now in both developed and developing
       countries. Information is available to help decision makers evaluate benefits and costs
       from adaptation and mitigation over a range of options and sustainable development
       pathways. Anticipated adaptation could be much less costly than reactive adaptation.
       Mitigation of climate change can reduce and postpone the impacts, lowering the damages
       and giving human societies as well as animals and plants more time to adapt.

       Further Work

9.42   Significant progress has been made in the TAR in many aspects of the                                       WGI TAR SPM, WGII TAR
                                                                                                                  SPM, & WGIII TAR SPM
       knowledge required to understand climate change and the human response
       to it. However, there remain important areas where further work is required, in particular:
        • The detection and attribution of climate change
        • The understanding and prediction of regional changes in climate and climate extremes
        • The quantification of climate change impacts at the global, regional, and local levels
        • The analysis of adaptation and mitigation activities
        • The integration of all aspects of the climate change issue into strategies for sustainable
           development
        • Comprehensive and integrated investigations to support the judgment as to what
           constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”

Figure 1: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature over the last 140 years and the last millennium. (a) The Earth’s surface
temperature is shown year by year (red bars) and approximately decade by decade (black line, a filtered annual curve suppressing fluctuations
below near decadal time-scales). There are uncertainties in the annual data (thin black whisker bars represent the 95% confidence range)
due to data gaps, random instrumental errors and uncertainties, uncertainties in bias corrections in the ocean surface temperature data and
also in adjustments for urbanisation over the land. Over both the last 140 years and 100 years, the best estimate is that the global average
surface temperature has increased by 0.6 ± 0.2°C. (b) Additionally, the year by year (blue curve) and 50 year average (black curve) variations
of the average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere for the past 1000 years have been reconstructed from “proxy” data calibrated
against thermometer data (see list of the main proxy data in the diagram). The 95% confidence range in the annual data is represented by
the grey region. These uncertainties increase in more distant times and are always much larger than in the instrumental record due to the use
of relatively sparse proxy data. Nevertheless the rate and duration of warming of the 20th century has been much greater than in any of the
previous nine centuries. Similarly, it is likely7 that the 1990s have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year of the millennium.

      Figure 3: Many external factors force climate change. These radiative forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration
      of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the output of the sun. Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked to
      each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions of these forcings - some of which yield warming, and some cooling. Forcing
      due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting only for a few years, is not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown
      is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect effect of aerosols on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which
      would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on greenhouse gases are included in the individual bars. The vertical
      line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the spread in the published values of the forcings and physical
      understanding. Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than others. A vertical line without a rectangular bar
      denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall level of scientific understanding for each
      forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the globe, such as CO2, thereby perturbing the
      global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial distribution, such as aerosols.
      For this and other reasons, a simple sum of the positive and negative bars cannot be expected to yield the net effect on the climate system.
      The simulations of this assessment report (for example, Figure 5) indicate that the estimated net effect of these perturbations is to have
      warmed the global climate since 1750. [Based upon Chapter 6, Figure 6.6]

Figure 4: Simulating the Earth’s temperature variations, and comparing the results to measured changes, can provide insight into
the underlying causes of the major changes. A climate model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur both from
natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and
volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of
sulphate aerosols, and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it
can be seen that inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation for a substantial part of the observed temperature
changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic factors are
included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility that
other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results presented here are for four runs from the same model. Similar results
to those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing. [Based upon Chapter 12, Figure 12.7]

      Figure 5: The global climate of the 21st century will depend on natural changes and the response of the climate system to human
      activities. Climate models project the response of many climate variables – such as increases in global surface temperature and sea level – to
      various scenarios of greenhouse gas and other human-related emissions. (a) shows the CO2 emissions of the six illustrative SRES scenarios,
      which are summarised in the box on page 18, along with IS92a for comparison purposes with the SAR. (b) shows projected CO2 concentrations.
      (c) shows anthropogenic SO2 emissions. Emissions of other gases and other aerosols were included in the model but are not shown in the
      figure. (d) and (e) show the projected temperature and sea level responses, respectively. The “several models all SRES envelope” in (d) and
      (e) shows the temperature and sea level rise, respectively, for the simple model when tuned to a number of complex models with a range of
      climate sensitivities. All SRES envelopes refer to the full range of 35 SRES scenarios. The “model average all SRES envelope” shows the
      average from these models for the range of scenarios. Note that the warming and sea level rise from these emissions would continue well
      beyond 2100. Also note that this range does not allow for uncertainty relating to ice dynamical changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet, nor
      does it account for uncertainties in projecting non-sulphate aerosols and greenhouse gas concentrations. [Based upon (a) Chapter 3, Figure

          Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over
          time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.
          This usage differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate
          Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is
          attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
          composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural

 Figure 9: Global, annual-mean radiative forcings (Wm–2) due to a number of agents for the period from pre-industrial (1750) to present (late
 1990s; about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11 of Chapter 6). For detailed explanations, see Chapter 6.13. The height of
 the rectangular bar denotes a central or best estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about
 the rectangular bar with “x” delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the spread in the published
 values of the forcing. A vertical line without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be
 given owing to large uncertainties. The uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term
 elsewhere in this document. A “level of scientific understanding” index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low and very low
 levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the
 assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and
 the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped
 together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO2, CH4, N2O and halocarbons shown (see Tables 6.1
 and 6.11). Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” and “organic carbon” components with its separate best estimate and range.
 The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood. The
 same is true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the “first” type of indirect effect due to aerosols as
 applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The “second” type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists very little
 confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly
 variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal
 features (Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They
 are only intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain
 the climate response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global
 mean forcings cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on Figure 6.6]

         No single lifetime can be defined for CO2 because of different rates of uptake by different removal processes.

         This lifetime has been defined as an “adjustment time” that takes into account the indirect effect of the gas on its own residence time.

         Note that the uncertainties cited in this table are ±1 standard error. The uncertainties cited in the SAR were ±1.6 standard error (i.e., approximately
         90% confidence interval). Uncertainties cited from the SAR were adjusted to ±1 standard error. Error bars denote uncertainty, not interannual
         variability, which is substantially greater.

         The fossil fuel emissions term for the 1980s has been revised slightly downward since the SAR.

         The land-atmosphere flux represents the balance of a positive term due to land-use change and a residual terrestrial sink. The two terms cannot be
         separated on the basis of current atmospheric measurements. Using independent analyses to estimate the land-use change component for 1980 to
         1989, the residual terrestrial sink can be inferred as follows: Land-use change 1.7 PgC/yr (0.6 to 2.5); Residual terrestrial sink –1.9 PgC/yr (–3.8
         to 0.3). Comparable data for the 1990s are not yet available.

      Methane (CH4)

      Atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations have increased
      by about 150% (1,060 ppb) since 1750. The present CH4
      concentration has not been exceeded during the past 420,000
      years. Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas with both natural
      (e.g., wetlands) and human-influenced sources (e.g., agriculture,
      natural gas activities, and landfills). Slightly more than half of
      current CH4 emissions are anthropogenic. It is removed from
      the atmosphere by chemical reactions. As Figure 11 shows,
      systematic, globally representative measurements of the
      concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere have been made since
      1983, and the record of atmospheric concentrations has been
      extended to earlier times from air extracted from ice cores
      and firn layers. The current direct radiative forcing of 0.48
      Wm–2 from CH4 is 20% of the total from all of the long-lived
      and globally mixed greenhouse gases (see Figure 9).

      The atmospheric abundance of CH4 continues to increase, from
      about 1,610 ppb in 1983 to 1,745 ppb in 1998, but the observed
      annual increase has declined during this period. The increase
      was highly variable during the 1990s; it was near zero in 1992
      and as large as 13 ppb during 1998. There is no clear
      quantitative explanation for this variability. Since the SAR,
      quantification of certain anthropogenic sources of CH4, such
      as that from rice production, has improved.

      The rate of increase in atmospheric CH4 is due to a small
      imbalance between poorly characterised sources and sinks, which
      makes the prediction of future concentrations problematic.
      Although the major contributors to the global CH4 budget              Figure 11: (a) Change in CH4 abundance (mole fraction, in ppb =

provided some potential insight into what processes control
the behaviour of atmospheric N2O, the multi-year trends of
this greenhouse gas remain largely unexplained.

The global budget of nitrous oxide is in better balance than
in the SAR, but uncertainties in the emissions from individual
sources are still quite large. Natural sources of N2O are estimated
to be approximately 10 TgN/yr (1990), with soils being about
65% of the sources and oceans about 30%. New, higher estimates

Table 3: Direct Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) relative to carbon dioxide (for gases for which the lifetimes have been
adequately characterised). GWPs are an index for estimating relative global warming contribution due to atmospheric emission
of a kg of a particular greenhouse gas compared to emission of a kg of carbon dioxide. GWPs calculated for different time
horizons show the effects of atmospheric lifetimes of the different gases. [Based upon Table 6.7]

       model simulations in the ensemble of four members. Note that the data are annual mean values. The model data are only sampled at the
       locations where there are observations. The changes in sulphate aerosol are calculated interactively, and changes in tropospheric ozone were
       calculated offline using a chemical transport model. Changes in cloud brightness (the first indirect effect of sulphate aerosols) were calculated
       by an offline simulation and included in the model. The changes in stratospheric ozone were based on observations. The volcanic and solar
       forcing were based on published combinations of measured and proxy data. The net anthropogenic forcing at 1990 was 1.0 Wm–2 including a net
       cooling of 1.0 Wm–2 due to sulphate aerosols. The net natural forcing for 1990 relative to 1860 was 0.5 Wm–2, and for 1992 was a net cooling of
       2.0 Wm–2 due to Mount Pinatubo. Other models forced with anthropogenic forcing give similar results to those shown in (b). [Based on Figure 12.7]

      Figure 16: (a) Estimates of the “scaling factors” by which the amplitude of several model-simulated signals must be multiplied to reproduce
      the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A
      range encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding
      observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable. Signals are defined as the
      ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5,000 km) near-surface temperatures over the 1946 to 1996 period
      relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained with the assumption
      that the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than one
      (consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly over predict the observed
      warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with
      two cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and
      GSIO, respectively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically
      over- or under-predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and internal
      variability are an adequate representation (i.e., that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual variability
      is consistent with this assumption in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). One is obliged to make this assumption to include
      models for which only a simulation of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single signal cases are
      incomplete since they do not account for uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of
      confidence with which internal variability, as simulated by these various models, can be rejected as an explanation of recent near-surface
      temperature change. A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling factors
      on individual greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in which the
      relevant simulations have been performed. In these cases, multiple factors are estimated simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the
      amplitude of the naturally forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one
      case (ECHAM3) the model appears to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but
      this result is sensitive to which component of the control is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would respond to
      the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals remain
      detectable and consistent with unity independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors
      in S and V responses). (b) Estimated contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5
      to 95% confidence intervals. Although the estimates vary depending on which model’s signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less
      certain if more than one signal is estimated, all show a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming.

       Regions are classified as showing either agreement on warming in excess of 40% above the global average (‘Much greater than average
       warming’), agreement on warming greater than the global average (‘Greater than average warming’), agreement on warming less than the
       global average (‘Less than average warming’), or disagreement amongst models on the magnitude of regional relative warming (‘Inconsistent
       magnitude of warming’). There is also a category for agreement on cooling (which never occurs). A consistent result from at least seven of
       the nine models is deemed necessary for agreement. The global annual average warming of the models used span 1.2 to 4.5°C for A2 and
       0.9 to 3.4°C for B2, and therefore a regional 40% amplification represents warming ranges of 1.7 to 6.3°C for A2 and 1.3 to 4.7°C for B2.

       Figure SPM-2: Reasons for concern about projected climate change impacts. The risks of adverse impacts from climate change increase
       with the magnitude of climate change. The left part of the figure displays the observed temperature increase relative to 1990 and the range of
       projected temperature increase after 1990 as estimated by Working Group I of the IPCC for scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions
       Scenarios. The right panel displays conceptualizations of five reasons for concern regarding climate change risks evolving through 2100.
       White indicates neutral or small negative or positive impacts or risks, yellow indicates negative impacts for some systems or low risks, and
       red means negative impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or greater in magnitude. The assessment of impacts or risks takes into
       account only the magnitude of change and not the rate of change. Global mean annual temperature change is used in the figure as a proxy
       for the magnitude of climate change, but projected impacts will be a function of, among other factors, the magnitude and rate of global and
       regional changes in mean climate, climate variability and extreme climate phenomena, social and economic conditions, and adaptation.

      Region      Adaptive Capacity, Vulnerability, and Key Concerns
      Africa       • Adaptive capacity of human systems in Africa is low due to lack of economic resources and technology, and
                     vulnerability high as a result of heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, frequent droughts and floods, and
                     poverty. [5.1.7]
                   • Grain yields are projected to decrease for many scenarios, diminishing food security, particularly in small
                     food-importing countries (medium to high confidence6). [5.1.2]
                   • Major rivers of Africa are highly sensitive to climate variation; average runoff and water availability would
                     decrease in Mediterranean and southern countries of Africa (medium confidence6). [5.1.1]
                   • Extension of ranges of infectious disease vectors would adversely affect human health in Africa (medium
                     confidence6). [5.1.4]
                   • Desertification would be exacerbated by reductions in average annual rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture,
                     especially in southern, North, and West Africa (medium confidence6). [5.1.6]
                   • Increases in droughts, floods, and other extreme events would add to stresses on water resources, food security,
                     human health, and infrastructures, and would constrain development in Africa (high confidence6). [5.1]
                   • Significant extinctions of plant and animal species are projected and would impact rural livelihoods, tourism,
                     and genetic resources (medium confidence6). [5.1.3]
                   • Coastal settlements in, for example, the Gulf of Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Egypt, and along the East-Southern
                     African coast would be adversely impacted by sea-level rise through inundation and coastal erosion (high
                     confidence6). [5.1.5]
      Asia         • Adaptive capacity of human systems is low and vulnerability is high in the developing countries of Asia; the
                     developed countries of Asia are more able to adapt and less vulnerable. [5.2.7]
                   • Extreme events have increased in temperate and tropical Asia, including floods, droughts, forest fires, and
                     tropical cyclones (high confidence6). [5.2.4]
                   • Decreases in agricultural productivity and aquaculture due to thermal and water stress, sea-level rise, floods and
                     droughts, and tropical cyclones would diminish food security in many countries of arid, tropical, and temperate
                     Asia; agriculture would expand and increase in productivity in northern areas (medium confidence6). [5.2.1]
                   • Runoff and water availability may decrease in arid and semi-arid Asia but increase in northern Asia (medium
                     confidence6). [5.2.3]
                   • Human health would be threatened by possible increased exposure to vector-borne infectious diseases and
                     heat stress in parts of Asia (medium confidence6). [5.2.6]
                   • Sea-level rise and an increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones would displace tens of millions of people in
                     low-lying coastal areas of temperate and tropical Asia; increased intensity of rainfall would increase flood
                     risks in temperate and tropical Asia (high confidence6). [5.2.5 and Table TS-8]
                   • Climate change would increase energy demand, decrease tourism attraction, and influence transportation in
                     some regions of Asia (medium confidence6). [5.2.4 and 5.2.7]
                   • Climate change would exacerbate threats to biodiversity due to land-use and land-cover change and population
                     pressure in Asia (medium confidence6). Sea-level rise would put ecological security at risk, including mangroves
                     and coral reefs (high confidence6). [5.2.2]
                   • Poleward movement of the southern boundary of the permafrost zones of Asia would result in a change of

                     balance is expected to become negative for some areas and crops with further climate change (medium
                     confidence6). [5.3.3]
                   • Water is likely to be a key issue (high confidence6) due to projected drying trends over much of the region and

Region        Adaptive Capacity, Vulnerability, and Key Concerns
Europe         • Adaptive capacity is generally high in Europe for human systems; southern Europe and the European Arctic
                 are more vulnerable than other parts of Europe. [5.4 and 5.4.6]
               • Summer runoff, water availability, and soil moisture are likely to decrease in southern Europe, and would
                 widen the difference between the north and drought-prone south; increases are likely in winter in the north
                 and south (high confidence6). [5.4.1]
               • Half of alpine glaciers and large permafrost areas could disappear by end of the 21st century (medium
                 confidence6). [5.4.1]
               • River flood hazard will increase across much of Europe (medium to high confidence6); in coastal areas, the
                 risk of flooding, erosion, and wetland loss will increase substantially with implications for human settlement,
                 industry, tourism, agriculture, and coastal natural habitats. [5.4.1 and 5.4.4]
               • There will be some broadly positive effects on agriculture in northern Europe (medium confidence6);
                 productivity will decrease in southern and eastern Europe (medium confidence6). [5.4.3]
               • Upward and northward shift of biotic zones will take place. Loss of important habitats (wetlands, tundra,
                 isolated habitats) would threaten some species (high confidence6). [5.4.2]
               • Higher temperatures and heat waves may change traditional summer tourist destinations, and less reliable
                 snow conditions may impact adversely on winter tourism (medium confidence6). [5.4.4]
Latin          • Adaptive capacity of human systems in Latin America is low, particularly with respect to extreme climate
America          events, and vulnerability is high. [5.5]
               • Loss and retreat of glaciers would adversely impact runoff and water supply in areas where glacier melt is an
                 important water source (high confidence6). [5.5.1]
               • Floods and droughts would become more frequent with floods increasing sediment loads and degrade water
                 quality in some areas (high confidence6). [5.5]
               • Increases in intensity of tropical cyclones would alter the risks to life, property, and ecosystems from heavy
                 rain, flooding, storm surges, and wind damages (high confidence6). [5.5]
               • Yields of important crops are projected to decrease in many locations in Latin America, even when the effects
                 of CO2 are taken into account; subsistence farming in some regions of Latin America could be threatened
                 (high confidence6). [5.5.4]
               • The geographical distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases would expand poleward and to higher
                 elevations, and exposures to diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and cholera will increase (medium
                 confidence6). [5.5.5]
               • Coastal human settlements, productive activities, infrastructure, and mangrove ecosystems would be negatively
                 affected by sea-level rise (medium confidence6). [5.5.3]
               • The rate of biodiversity loss would increase (high confidence6). [5.5.2]
North          • Adaptive capacity of human systems is generally high and vulnerability low in North America, but some
America          communities (e.g., indigenous peoples and those dependent on climate-sensitive resources) are more vulnerable;
                 social, economic, and demographic trends are changing vulnerabilities in subregions. [5.6 and 5.6.1]
               • Some crops would benefit from modest warming accompanied by increasing CO2, but effects would vary
                 among crops and regions (high confidence6), including declines due to drought in some areas of Canada’s
                 Prairies and the U.S. Great Plains, potential increased food production in areas of Canada north of current
                 production areas, and increased warm-temperate mixed forest production (medium confidence6). However,
                 benefits for crops would decline at an increasing rate and possibly become a net loss with further warming
                 (medium confidence6). [5.6.4]
               • Snowmelt-dominated watersheds in western North America will experience earlier spring peak flows (high
                 confidence6), reductions in summer flows (medium confidence6), and reduced lake levels and outflows for the
                 Great Lakes-St. Lawrence under most scenarios (medium confidence6); adaptive responses would offset some,
                 but not all, of the impacts on water users and on aquatic ecosystems (medium confidence6). [5.6.2]
               • Unique natural ecosystems such as prairie wetlands, alpine tundra, and cold-water ecosystems will be at risk
                 and effective adaptation is unlikely (medium confidence6). [5.6.5]
               • Sea-level rise would result in enhanced coastal erosion, coastal flooding, loss of coastal wetlands, and increased
                 risk from storm surges, particularly in Florida and much of the U.S. Atlantic coast (high confidence6). [5.6.1]
               • Weather-related insured losses and public sector disaster relief payments in North America have been increasing;
                 insurance sector planning has not yet systematically included climate change information, so there is potential
                 for surprise (high confidence6). [5.6.1]
               • Vector-borne diseases—including malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease—may expand their ranges in
                 North America; exacerbated air quality and heat stress morbidity and mortality would occur (medium
                 confidence6); socioeconomic factors and public health measures would play a large role in determining the
                 incidence and extent of health effects. [5.6.6]

      Region       Adaptive Capacity, Vulnerability, and Key Concerns
      Polar         • Natural systems in polar regions are highly vulnerable to climate change and current ecosystems have low
                      adaptive capacity; technologically developed communities are likely to adapt readily to climate change, but
                      some indigenous communities, in which traditional lifestyles are followed, have little capacity and few options
                      for adaptation. [5.7]
                    • Climate change in polar regions is expected to be among the largest and most rapid of any region on the Earth,
                      and will cause major physical, ecological, sociological, and economic impacts, especially in the Arctic, Antarctic
                      Peninsula, and Southern Ocean (high confidence6). [5.7]
                    • Changes in climate that have already taken place are manifested in the decrease in extent and thickness of
                      Arctic sea ice, permafrost thawing, coastal erosion, changes in ice sheets and ice shelves, and altered distribution
                      and abundance of species in polar regions (high confidence6). [5.7]
                    • Some polar ecosystems may adapt through eventual replacement by migration of species and changing species
                      composition, and possibly by eventual increases in overall productivity; ice edge systems that provide habitat
                      for some species would be threatened (medium confidence6). [5.7]
                    • Polar regions contain important drivers of climate change. Once triggered, they may continue for centuries,
                      long after greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized, and cause irreversible impacts on ice sheets, global
                      ocean circulation, and sea-level rise (medium confidence6). [5.7]
      Small         • Adaptive capacity of human systems is generally low in small island states, and vulnerability high; small
      Island          island states are likely to be among the countries most seriously impacted by climate change. [5.8]
      States        • The projected sea-level rise of 5 mm yr–1 for the next 100 years would cause enhanced coastal erosion, loss of
                      land and property, dislocation of people, increased risk from storm surges, reduced resilience of coastal
                      ecosystems, saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources, and high resource costs to respond to and adapt to
                      these changes (high confidence6). [5.8.2 and 5.8.5]
                    • Islands with very limited water supplies are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on the water
                      balance (high confidence6). [5.8.4]
                    • Coral reefs would be negatively affected by bleaching and by reduced calcification rates due to higher CO
                                                                                                                                     2
                      levels (medium confidence6); mangrove, sea grass bed, and other coastal ecosystems and the associated
                      biodiversity would be adversely affected by rising temperatures and accelerated sea-level rise (medium
                      confidence6). [4.4 and 5.8.3]
                    • Declines in coastal ecosystems would negatively impact reef fish and threaten reef fisheries, those who earn
                      their livelihoods from reef fisheries, and those who rely on the fisheries as a significant food source (medium
                      confidence6). [4.4 and 5.8.4]
                    • Limited arable land and soil salinization makes agriculture of small island states, both for domestic food
                      production and cash crop exports, highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence6). [5.8.4]
                    • Tourism, an important source of income and foreign exchange for many islands, would face severe disruption
                      from climate change and sea-level rise (high confidence6). [5.8.5]
      a
        Because the available studies have not employed a common set of climate scenarios and methods, and because of uncertainties regarding the
        sensitivities and adaptability of natural and social systems, the assessment of regional vulnerabilities is necessarily qualitative.

       large events increased 10.3-fold from US$4 billion yr–1 in the 1950s to US$40 billion yr–1 in the 1990s (all in 1999 US$). The insured portion
       of these losses rose from a negligible level to US$9.2 billion annually during the same period, and the ratio of premiums to catastrophe
       losses fell by two-thirds. Notably, costs are larger by a factor of 2 when losses from ordinary, noncatastrophic weather-related events are
       included. The numbers generally include “captive” self-insurers but not the less-formal types of self-insurance.

Sector                Key Findings

Water Resources - Water managers have experience with adapting to change. Many techniques exist to assess and
                  implement adaptive options. However, the pervasiveness of climate change may preclude some
                  traditional adaptive strategies, and available adaptations often are not used.
                - Adaptation can involve management on the supply side (e.g., altering infrastructure or institutional
                  arrangements) and on the demand side (changing demand or risk reduction). Numerous no-regret
                  policies exist, which will generate net social benefits regardless of climate change.
                - Climate change is just one of numerous pressures facing water managers. Nowhere are water management
                  decisions taken solely to cope with climate change, although it is increasingly considered for future
                  resource management. Some vulnerabilities are outside the conventional responsibility of water managers.
                - Estimates of the economic costs of climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on
                  assumptions made about adaptation. Economically optimum adaptation may be prevented by
                  constraints associated with uncertainty, institutions, and equity.
                - Extreme events often are catalysts for change in water management, by exposing vulnerabilities and
                  raising awareness of climate risks. Climate change modifies indicators of extremes and variability,
                  complicating adaptation decisions.
                - Ability to adapt is affected by institutional capacity, wealth, management philosophy, planning time
                  scale, organizational and legal framework, technology, and population mobility.
                - Water managers need research and management tools aimed at adapting to uncertainty and change,
                  rather than improving climate scenarios.

Ecosystems and        - Adaptation to loss of some ecosystem services may be possible, especially in managed ecosystems.
Their Services          However, adaptation to losses in wild ecosystems and biodiversity may be difficult or impossible.
                      - There is considerable capacity for adaptation in agriculture, including crop changes and resource
                        substitutions, but adaptation to evolving climate change and interannual variability is uncertain.
                      - Adaptations in agriculture are possible, but they will not happen without considerable transition costs
                        and equilibrium (or residual) costs.
                      - Greater adverse impacts are expected in areas where resource endowments are poorest and the ability
                        of farmers to adapt is most limited.
                      - In many countries where rangelands are important, lack of infrastructure and investment in resource
                        management limit options for adaptation.
                      - Commercial forestry is adaptable, reflecting a history of long-term management decisions under
                        uncertainty. Adaptations are expected in land-use management (species-selection silviculture) and
                        product management (processing-marketing).
                      - Adaptation in developed countries will fare better, while developing countries and countries in
                        transition, especially in the tropics and subtropics, will fare worse.

Coastal Zones         - Without adaptations, the consequences of global warming and sea-level rise would be disastrous.
                      - Coastal adaptation entails more than just selecting one of the technical options to respond to sea-level
                        rise (strategies can aim to protect, accommodate, or retreat). It is a complex and iterative process
                        rather than a simple choice.
                      - Adaptation options are more acceptable and effective when they are incorporated into coastal zone
                        management, disaster mitigation programs, land-use planning, and sustainable development strategies.
                      - Adaptation choices will be conditioned by existing policies and development objectives, requiring
                        researchers and policymakers to work toward a commonly acceptable framework for adaptation.
                      - The adaptive capacity of coastal systems to perturbations is related to coastal resilience, which has
                        morphological, ecological, and socioeconomic components. Enhancing resilience—including the technical,
                        institutional, economic, and cultural capability to cope with impacts—is a particularly appropriate
                        adaptive strategy given future uncertainties and the desire to maintain development opportunities.
                      - Coastal communities and marine-based economic sectors with low exposure or high adaptive capacity
                        will be least affected. Communities with lower economic resources, poorer infrastructure, less-
                        developed communications and transportation systems, and weak social support systems have less
                        access to adaptation options and are more vulnerable.

Human                 - Larger and more costly impacts of climate change occur through changed probabilities of extreme
Settlements,            weather events that overwhelm the design resiliency of human systems.
Energy, and           - Many adaptation options are available to reduce the vulnerability of settlements. However, urban
Industry                managers, especially in developing countries, have so little capacity to deal with current problems
                        (housing, sanitation, water, and power) that dealing with climate change risks is beyond their means.
                      - Lack of financial resources, weak institutions, and inadequate or inappropriate planning are major
                        barriers to adaptation in human settlements.
                      - Successful environmental adaptation cannot occur without locally based, technically competent, and
                        politically supported leadership.
                      - Uncertainty with respect to capacity and the will to respond hinder assessment of adaptation and
                        vulnerability.

       Table TS-14 (continued)

       Sector                Key Findings

       Insurance and         - Adaptation in financial and insurance services in the short term is likely to be to changing frequencies
       Other Financial         and intensities of extreme weather events.
       Services              - Increasing risk could lead to a greater volume of traditional business and development of new financial
                               risk management products, but increased variability of loss events would heighten actuarial uncertainty.
                             - Financial services firms have adaptability to external shocks, but there is little evidence that climate
                               change is being incorporated into investment decisions.
                             - The adaptive capacity of the financial sector is influenced by regulatory involvement, the ability of
                               firms to withdraw from at-risk markets, and fiscal policy regarding catastrophe reserves.
                             - Adaptation will involve changes in the roles of private and public insurance. Changes in the timing,
                               intensity, frequency, and/or spatial distribution of climate-related losses will generate increased
                               demand on already overburdened government insurance and disaster assistance programs.
                             - Developing countries seeking to adapt in a timely manner face particular difficulties, including limited
                               availability of capital, poor access to technology, and absence of government programs.
                             - Insurers’ adaptations include raising prices, non-renewal of policies, cessation of new policies,
                               limiting maximum claims, and raising deductibles—actions that can seriously affect investment in
                               developing countries.
                             - Developed countries generally have greater adaptive capacity, including technology and economic
                               means to bear costs.

       Human Health          - Adaptation involves changes in society, institutions, technology, or behavior to reduce potential
                               negative impacts or increase positive ones. There are numerous adaptation options, which may occur
                               at the population, community, or personal levels.
                             - The most important and cost-effective adaptation measure is to rebuild public health infrastructure—
                               which, in much of the world, has declined in recent years. Many diseases and health problems that
                               may be exacerbated by climate change can be effectively prevented with adequate financial and
                               human public health resources, including training, surveillance and emergency response, and
                               prevention and control programs.
                             - Adaptation effectiveness will depend on timing. “Primary” prevention aims to reduce risks before
                               cases occur, whereas “secondary” interventions are designed to prevent further cases.
                             - Determinants of adaptive capacity to climate-related threats include level of material resources,
                               effectiveness of governance and civil institutions, quality of public health infrastructure, and
                               preexisting burden of disease.
                             - Capacity to adapt also will depend on research to understand associations between climate, weather,
                               extreme events, and vector-borne diseases.

Table TS-15: Adaptation and capacity in regions (key findings from Chapters 10 through 17).

Sector                Key Findings

Africa                - Adaptive measures would enhance flexibility and have net benefits in water resources (irrigation and
                        water reuse, aquifer and groundwater management, desalinization), agriculture (crop changes,
                        technology, irrigation, husbandry), and forestry (regeneration of local species, energy-efficient cook
                        stoves, sustainable community management).
                      - Without adaptation, climate change will reduce the wildlife reserve network significantly by altering
                        ecosystems and causing species’ emigrations and extinctions. This represents an important ecological
                        and economic vulnerability in Africa.
                      - A risk-sharing approach between countries will strengthen adaptation strategies, including disaster
                        management, risk communication, emergency evacuation, and cooperative water resource management.
                      - Most countries in Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate change because of limited adaptive
                        capacity as a result of widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution, and
                        dependence on rainfed agriculture.
                      - Enhancement of adaptive capacity requires local empowerment in decisionmaking and incorporation
                        of climate adaptation within broader sustainable development strategies.

Asia                  - Priority areas for adaptation are land and water resources, food productivity, and disaster
                        preparedness and planning, particularly for poorer, resource-dependent countries.
                      - Adaptations already are required to deal with vulnerabilities associated with climate variability, in
                        human health, coastal settlements, infrastructure, and food security. Resilience of most sectors in Asia
                        to climate change is very poor. Expansion of irrigation will be difficult and costly in many countries.
                      - For many developing countries in Asia, climate change is only one of a host of problems to deal with,
                        including nearer term needs such as hunger, water supply and pollution, and energy. Resources
                        available for adaptation to climate are limited. Adaptation responses are closely linked to
                        development activities, which should be considered in evaluating adaptation options.
                      - Early signs of climate change already have been observed and may become more prominent over 1 or
                        2 decades. If this time is not used to design and implement adaptations, it may be too late to avoid
                        upheavals. Long-term adaptation requires anticipatory actions.
                      - A wide range of precautionary measures are available at the regional and national level to reduce
                        economic and social impacts of disasters. These strategies include awareness-building and expansion
                        of the insurance industry.
                      - Development of effective adaptation strategies requires local involvement, inclusion of community
                        perceptions, and recognition of multiple stresses on sustainable management of resources.
                      - Adaptive capacities vary between countries, depending on social structure, culture, economic capacity,
                        and level of environmental disruptions. Limiting factors include poor resource and infrastructure
                        bases, poverty and disparities in income, weak institutions, and limited technology.
                      - The challenge in Asia lies in identifying opportunities to facilitate sustainable development with
                        strategies that make climate-sensitive sectors resilient to climate variability.
                      - Adaptation strategies would benefit from taking a more systems-oriented approach, emphasizing
                        multiple interactive stresses, with less dependence on climate scenarios.

Australia and         - Adaptations are needed to manage risks from climatic variability and extremes. Pastoral economies
New Zealand             and communities have considerable adaptability but are vulnerable to any increase in the frequency or
                        duration of droughts.
                      - Adaptation options include water management, land-use practices and policies, engineering standards
                        for infrastructure, and health services.
                      - Adaptations will be viable only if they are compatible with the broader ecological and socioeconomic
                        environment, have net social and economic benefits, and are taken up by stakeholders.
                      - Adaptation responses may be constrained by conflicting short- and long-term planning horizons.
                      - Poorer communities, including many indigenous settlements, are particularly vulnerable to climate-
                        related hazards and stresses on health because they often are in exposed areas and have less adequate
                        housing, health care, and other resources for adaptation.

Europe                - Adaptation potential in socioeconomic systems is relatively high because strong economic conditions,
                        stable population (with capacity to migrate), and well-developed political, institutional, and
                        technological support systems.
                      - The response of human activities and the natural environment to current weather perturbations
                        provides a guide to critical sensitivities under future climate change.
                      - Adaptation in forests requires long-term planning; it is unlikely that adaptation measures will be put in
                        place in a timely manner.
                      - Farm-level analyses show that if adaptation is fully implemented large reductions in adverse impacts
                        are possible.
                      - Adaptation for natural systems generally is low.
                      - More marginal and less wealthy areas will be less able to adapt; thus, without appropriate policies of
                        response, climate change may lead to greater inequities.


                                                                                                                                    283

       Table TS-15 (continued)

       Sector                Key Findings

       Latin America         - Adaptation measures have potential to reduce climate-related losses in agriculture and forestry.
                             - There are opportunities for adapting to water shortages and flooding through water resource management.
                             - Adaptation measures in the fishery sector include changing species captured and increasing prices to
                               reduce losses.

       North America         - Strain on social and economic systems from rapid climate and sea-level changes will increase the need
                               for explicit adaptation strategies. In some cases, adaptation may yield net benefits, especially if
                               climate change is slow.
                             - Stakeholders in most sectors believe that technology is available to adapt, although at some social and
                               economic cost.
                             - Adaptation is expected to be more successful in agriculture and forestry. However, adaptations for water,
                               health, food, energy, and cities are likely to require substantial institutional and infrastructure changes.
                             - In the water sector, adaptations to seasonal runoff changes include storage, conjunctive supply
                               management, and transfer. It may not be possible to continue current high levels of reliability of water
                               supply, especially with transfers to high-valued uses. Adaptive measures such as “water markets” may
                               lead to concerns about accessibility and conflicts over allocation priorities.
                             - Adaptations such as levees and dams often are successful in managing most variations in weather but
                               can increase vulnerability to the most extreme events.
                             - There is moderate potential for adaptation through conservation programs that protect particularly
                               threatened ecosystems, such as high alpines and wetlands. It may be difficult or impossible to offset
                               adverse impacts on aquatic systems.

       Polar Regions         - Adaptation will occur in natural polar ecosystems through migration and changing mixes of species.
                               Species such as walrus, seals, and polar bears will be threatened; while others, such as fish, may flourish.
                             - Potential for adaptation is limited in indigenous communities that follow traditional lifestyles.
                             - Technologically developed communities are likely to adapt quite readily, although the high capital
                               investment required may result in costs in maintaining lifestyles.
                             - Adaptation depends on technological advances, institutional arrangements, availability of financing,
                               and information exchange.

       Small Island          - The need for adaptation has become increasingly urgent, even if swift implementation of global
       States                  agreements to reduce future emissions occurs.
                             - Most adaptation will be carried out by people and communities that inhabit island countries; support
                               from governments is essential for implementing adaptive measures.
                             - Progress will require integration of appropriate risk-reduction strategies with other sectoral policy
                               initiatives in areas such as sustainable development planning, disaster prevention and management,
                               integrated coastal zone management, and health care planning.
                             - Strategies for adaptation to sea-level rise are retreat, accommodate, and protect. Measures such as
                               retreat to higher ground, raising of the land, and use of building set-backs appear to have little
                               practical utility, especially when hindered by limited physical size.
                             - Measures for reducing the severity of health threats include health education programs, health care
                               facilities, sewerage and solid waste management, and disaster preparedness plans.
                             - Islanders have developed some capacity to adapt by application of traditional knowledge, locally
                               appropriate technology, and customary practice. Overall adaptive capacity is low, however, because of
                               the physical size of nations, limited access to capital and technology, shortage of human resource
                               skills, lack of tenure security, overcrowding, and limited access to resources for construction.
                             - Many small islands require external financial, technical, and other assistance to adapt. Adaptive
                               capacity may be enhanced by regional cooperation and pooling of limited resources.

    Figure SPM-1: Comparison of reference and stabilization scenarios. The figure is divided into six parts, one for each of the reference
    scenario groups from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, see Box SPM-1). Each part of the figure shows the range of total
    global CO2 emissions (gigatonnes of carbon (GtC)) from all anthropogenic sources for the SRES reference scenario group (shaded in grey)
    and the ranges for the various mitigation scenarios assessed in the TAR leading to stabilization of CO2 concentrations at various levels
    (shaded in colour). Scenarios are presented for the A1 family subdivided into three groups (the balanced A1B group (Figure SPM-1a), non-
    fossil fuel A1T (Figure SPM-1b) and the fossil intensive A1FI (Figure SPM-1c)) with stabilization of CO2 concentrations at 450, 550, 650 and
    750 ppmv; for the A2 group with stabilization at 550 and 750 ppmv in Figure SPM-1d, the B1 group with stabilization at 450 and 550 ppmv
    in Figure SPM-1e, and the B2 group with stabilization at 450, 550 and 650 ppmv in Figure SPM-1f. The literature is not available to assess
    1000 ppmv stabilization scenarios. The figure illustrates that the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider
    the gap. The difference between emissions in different scenario groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization
    scenarios within one scenario group. The dotted lines depict the boundaries of the ranges where they overlap.

 Figure SPM-2: Carbon in oil, gas and coal reserves and resources compared with historic fossil fuel carbon emissions 1860–1998, and with
 cumulative carbon emissions from a range of SRES scenarios and TAR stabilization scenarios up until 2100. Data for reserves and resources
 are shown in the left hand columns (Section 3.8.2). Unconventional oil and gas includes tar sands, shale oil, other heavy oil, coal bed methane,
 deep geopressured gas, gas in acquifers, etc. Gas hydrates (clathrates) that amount to an estimated 12,000GtC are not shown. The scenario
 columns show both SRES reference scenarios as well as scenarios which lead to stabilization of CO2 concentrations at a range of levels.
 Note that if by 2100 cumulative emissions associated with SRES scenarios are equal to or smaller than those for stabilization scenarios, this
 does not imply that these scenarios equally lead to stabilization.

          Figure TS-2: Comparison of reference and stabilization scenarios. The figure is divided into six parts, one for each of the reference scenario
          groups from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Each part of the figure shows the range of total global CO2 emissions
          (gigatonnes of carbon (GtC)) from all anthropogenic sources for the SRES reference scenario group (shaded in grey) and the ranges for the
          various mitigation scenarios assessed in the TAR leading to stabilization of CO2 concentrations at various levels (shaded in colour). Scenarios
          are presented for the A1 family subdivided into three groups (the balanced A1B group (Figure TS-2a), non-fossil fuel A1T (Figure TS-2b), and
          the fossil intensive A1FI (Figure TS-2c)) and stabilization of CO2 concentrations at 450, 550, 650 and 750ppmv; for the A2 group with stabilization
          at 550 and 750ppmv in Figure TS-2d, the B1 group and stabilization at 450 and 550ppmv in Figure TS-2e, and the B2 group including
          stabilization at 450, 550, and 650ppmv in Figure TS-2f. The literature is not available to assess 1000ppmv stabilization scenarios. The figure
          illustrates that the lower the stabilization level and the higher the baseline emissions, the wider the gap. The difference between emissions
          in different scenario groups can be as large as the gap between reference and stabilization scenarios within one scenario group. The dotted
          lines depict the boundaries of the ranges where they overlap (see Box TS-1).

 cumulative carbon emissions from a range of SRES scenarios and TAR stabilization scenarios up until 2100. Data for reserves and resources
 are shown in the left hand columns. Unconventional oil and gas includes tar sands, shale oil, other heavy oil, coal bed methane, deep geopressured
 gas, gas in acquifers, etc. Gas hydrates (clathrates) that amount to an estimated 12,000 GtC are not shown. The scenario columns show both
 SRES reference scenarios as well as scenarios which lead to stabilization of CO2 concentrations at a range of levels. Note that if by 2100
 cumulative emissions associated with SRES scenarios are equal to or smaller than those for stabilization scenarios, this does not imply that these
 scenarios equally lead to stabilization.

 Note: The results of the Oxford model are not included in the ranges cited in the TS and SPM because this model has not been subject to substantive
 academic review (and hence is inappropriate for IPCC assessment), and relies on data from the early 1980s for a key parametization that determines
 the model results. This model is entirely unrelated to the CLIMOX model, from the Oxford Institutes of Energy Studies, referred to in Table TS-6.

     considered to address climate change regionally and globally?
 •   What portfolios of options of research and development,
     investments, and other policies might be considered that
     would be most effective to enhance the development and
     deployment of technologies that address climate change?
 •   What kind of economic and other policy options might be
     considered to remove existing and potential barriers and
     to stimulate private- and public-sector technology transfer
     and deployment among countries, and what effect might
     these have on projected emissions?
 •   How does the timing of the options contained in the above
     affect associated economic costs and benefits, and the

What is known about the interactions between projected
human-induced changes in climate and other environmental
issues (e.g., urban air pollution, regional acid deposition, loss
of biological diversity, stratospheric ozone depletion, and
desertification and land degradation)? What is known about
environmental, social, and economic costs and benefits and
implications of these interactions for integrating climate change
response strategies in an equitable manner into broad sustainable
development strategies at the local, regional, and global scales?

Question 9
What are the most robust findings and key uncertainties
regarding attribution of climate change and regarding model
projections of:
  • Future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols?
  • Future concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols?
  • Future changes in regional and global climate?
  • Regional and global impacts of climate change?
  • Costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation options?
