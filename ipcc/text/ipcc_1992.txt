      W i t h the formation o f the W o r l d C l i m a t e Programme after the 1979 W o r l d C l i m a t e Conference, the W o r l d
Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme - together with the International C o u n c i l o f
Scientific Unions - signalled their determination to pursue climate and climate change studies. Their joint efforts reached
a decision stage at the International Conference on the Assessment of the Role o f Carbon Dioxide and o f Other Greenhouse
Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts ( V i l l a c h , Austria, 1985); the findings o f the Conference and subse-
quent meetings on the subject laid the foundation for the current international activities on global wanning. A major
contributor to the activities is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I P C C ) , jointly established by our two orga-
nizations in 1988 under the Chairmanship o f Professor Bert B o l i n .


                  The Panel formed three W o r k i n g Groups


                  (a) to assess available scientific information on climate change ( W o r k i n g Group I),


                  (b) to assess environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change ( W o r k i n g Group II), and


                  (c) to formulate response strategies ( W o r k i n g Group III)


and a Special Committee on the Participation of Developing Countries to promote the participation of those countries in
its activities.


       The I P C C First Assessment Report was completed in August 1990 and consists of: the Overview, the I P C C Scientific
Assessment, the I P C C Impacts Assessment, the I P C C Response Strategies (the last three including the respective Policymaker
Summaries) and the Policymaker Summary o f the I P C C Special Committee. The Report has now become a standard-work
of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists and other experts and represents a remarkable co-ordinated effort by
hundreds of specialists from all over the world.


       Anticipating a continuing need for the most current information on climate change in the context o f the ongoing nego-
tiations on the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development ( R i o de Janeiro, June 1992), and as mandated by the governing bodies o f our two organizations, the I P C C
requested its three W o r k i n g Groups in M a r c h 1991 to produce updates o f their 1990 reports. The result is the 1992 I P C C
Supplement which was completed in February 1992. This volume contains the Supplement and the 1990 Overview and
Policymaker Summaries.


        Success in producing the Supplement has depended as in the past upon the whole-hearted enthusiasm and dedicated
hard work of scientists and other experts worldwide. W e admire, applaud and are very grateful for their commitment to the
I P C C process. W e take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Prof. B o l i n for his exemplary leadership of the I P C C .
W e congratulate the Chairmen o f the three I P C C W o r k i n g Groups, Sir John Houghton ( W o r k i n g Group I), Prof. Y u r i A .
Izrael ( W o r k i n g Group II) and M r . Robert A . Reinstein ( W o r k i n g Group III) for a job well done.


       W e thank the consortium o f 11 States that contributed financially towards this publication.

      The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I P C C ) , which I have been privileged to chair since its inception,
completed a comprehensive assessment o f the climate change issue in 1990 and an update to that assessment in February
1992. The Panel is going on to make another comprehensive assessment, as mandated by its sponsoring bodies (the W o r l d
Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme), by the middle of the 1990s.


       The Supplement is an update of key issues addressed in the 1990 I P C C assessment. Six tasks were chosen by the I P C C
in March 1991 for inclusion in the Supplement, after taking into account views expressed by á number of nations during the
first session of the Intergovemmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC).


      It has become clear in the course of the past year that common or consistent methodologies in a number o f subject
areas of climate change are of critical importance for uniform application by countries so as to enable intercomparisons among
them. Some examples are methodology for assessing national net emissions of greenhouse gases, methodology for nation-
al environmental impacts assessments and methodology for assessing national vulnerability to sea level rise. Development
of methodologies has been initiated and more w i l l be given high priority in the next few years.


       It is well known that there are a number o f uncertainties in the I P C C estimates o f climate wanming. The Panel has
neither hidden nor ignored them. It has made every effort - and w i l l continue to do so - to assess both their qualitative and
quantitative nature. In this effort, the I P C C welcomes critical examinations of its conclusions by all who are interested in
the issue, and invites the active participation of all the scientists and other experts who may disagree with its findings and
the presentation in detail o f their scientific analyses of altemative points o f view.


       The completion of the 1990 assessment and the 1992 Supplement would not at all have been possible without the
impressive amount o f work put in by a large number of scientists and other experts from many parts of the world, includ-
ing developing nations. I take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of them. I hope that they found the experience
stimulating - albeit perhaps a little exhausting - and that in the future they would find it worthwhile to continue to contribute
to the work o f the I P C C .


      I am particularly grateful to the Chairmen o f the three I P C C W o r k i n g Groups and the Special Committee on the
Participation of Developing Countries, their Vice-Chairs, Co-Chairs of the subgroups and lead authors. The credit for the
successful accomplishment o f each I P C C effort belongs very much to them.


      I am also grateful for the support provided by the two Executive Heads o f the sponsoring organizations and to the
Governments who have given support in spirit as well as in cash and kind.


      Finally, I wish to extend my thanks to M r . N . Sundararaman, the Secretary of I P C C , M r . S. Tewungwa and the staff
of the I P C C Secretariat whose commitment greatly facilitated the timely completion o f the tasks o f the I P C C .

The I P C C , at its seventh session (Geneva, 10-12 February
 1992), recognized with appreciation the dedicated work of
many scientists in preparing the reports and supporting
documents, especially considering the short time available
for their preparation. The I P C C considered and included
the supplementary reports from the W o r k i n g Groups as
contributions to the 1992 I P C C Supplement. The I P C C
requested that any m i n o r inconsistencies between the
W o r k i n g G r o u p reports be removed so far as possible.
Other inconsistencies w i l l be resolved in follow-up work.
It was noted that the supplementary reports are overviews
of the w o r k w h i c h has been c a r r i e d out and that the

grammes and to the national efforts supporting them i f the
new information necessary to reduce the uncertainties is to

port on a national or regional basis, and especially in
developing countries, the analysis of data relating to a wide
range of climate variables and the continued observation of
important variables with adequate coverage and accuracy.

                          Preface to the IPCC Overview


The IPCC First Assessment Report consists of

    this IPCC Overview,

•   the Policymaker Summaries of the three IPCC Working Groups (concerned with assessment
    respectively of the science, impacts and response strategies) and the IPCC Special Committee on
    the Participation of Developing Countries, and

    the three reports of the Working Groups.

The Overview brings together material from the four Policymaker Summaries. It presents
conclusions, proposes lines of possible action (including suggestions as to the factors which might
form the basis for negotiations) and outlines further work which is required for a more complete
understanding of the problems of climate change resulting from human activities.

Because the Overview cannot reflect all aspects of the problem which are presented in the three full
reports of the Working Groups and the four Policymaker Summaries, it should be read in conjunction
with them.

The issues, options and strategies presented in the Report are intended to assist policymakers and
future negotiators in their respective tasks. Further consideration of the Report should be given by
every government as it cuts across different sectors in all countries. It should be noted that the
Report reflects the technical assessment of experts rather than government positions, particularly
those governments that could not participate in all Working Groups of IPCC.

2 A l l of the scenarios assumed some level of compliance with the Montreal Protocol but not with all of the (June 1990) amendments
agreed to in London. The London amendments to the Montreal Protocol, when fully implemented, would result in a virtually
complete elimination of production of fully halogenated C F C s , halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform early in the 21st
century. The Parties of the Protocol also call for later elimination of H C F C s . Thus, the assumptions of Scenarios A and В
overestimate the radiative forcing potential of C F C s and halons. Additionally, the U N has provided recent population projections that
estimate higher population than used in the global model scenarios (Scenarios A through D); use of these newer projections would
increase future CO2 emissions. Additionally, the Reference Scenario CO2 emissions are higher than Scenario A (Business-as-Usual),
suggesting Scenario A (Business-as-Usual) may be an underestimate.

Method 2 (see         footnote 2 on previous page)

U s i n g the second method, the so-called Reference Scenario
was developed by the Energy and Industry Subgroup and
Agriculture and Forestry Subgroup of W o r k i n g G r o u p III.
Under the Reference Scenario, global C O , emissions from
all sectors grow from approximately 7.0 B t C (per year) in
1985 to over 15 B t C (per year) m 2 0 2 5 . T h e energy
contribution grows from about 5 B t C (per year) to over 12
B t C (per year). Primary energy demand more than doubles
between 1985 and 2025 with an average growth rate o f
2.1%. The per capita energy emissions in the industrialized
countries increase from 3.1 tonnes carbon ( T C ) in 1985 to
4.7 T C in 2025: for the developmg countries, they rise from
0.4 T C in 1985 to 0.8 T C in 2025.


Summary
A l l o f the above scenarios provide a conceptual basis for
considering possible future patterns of emissions and the
broad responses that might affect those patterns. N o full
assessment was made o f the total e c o n o m i c costs and
benefits, technological feasibility, or market potential of
the underlying policy assumptions. Because of the inherent
l i m i t a t i o n s i n o u r a b i l i t y to estimate future rates o f
population and economic growth, individual behaviour,
technological innovation, and other factors which are crucial
for determining emission rates over the course o f the next
century, there is some uncertainty in the projections o f
greenhouse gas e m i s s i o n s . R e f l e c t i n g these inherent
difficulties, the I P C C ' s work on emissions scenarios are
the best estimates at this time covering emissions over the
next century, but continued work to develop improved
assumptions and methods for scenario estimates w i l l be
useful to guide the development o f response strategies.

     the same period global sea level has increased by 10-
     20 c m . These increases have not been smooth with
     time, nor uniform over the globe.


     The size o f this warming is broadly consistent with
     predictions of climate models, but it is also of the same
     magnitude as natural climate variability. Thus the
     observed increase could be largely due to this natural
     v a r i a b i l i t y ; alternatively this variability and other
     human factors could have offset a still larger human-
     i n d u c e d greenhouse w a r m i n g . T h e u n e q u i v o c a l
     detection o f the enhanced greenhouse effect from
     observations is not likely for a decade or more.


     There is no firm evidence that climate has become
     more variable over the last few decades. However,
     with an increase in the mean temperature, episodes o f
     high temperatures w i l l most l i k e l y become more
     frequent in the future, and cold episodes less frequent.


     Ecosystems affect climate, and w i l l be affected by a
     changing climate and by increasing carbon dioxide
     concentrations. Rapid changes in climate w i l l change
     the c o m p o s i t i o n o f ecosystems; some species w i l l
     benefit while others w i l l be unable to migrate or adapt
     fast enough and may become extinct. Enhanced levels
     of carbon d i o x i d e may increase p r o d u c t i v i t y and
     efficiency o f water use o f vegetation. The effect o f
     warming on b i o l o g i c a l processes, although poorly
     understood,            m a y increase     the  atmospheric
     concentrations o f natural greenhouse gases.

then due to man's activities. Concentrations of nitrous oxide have increased since the mid-l8th century, especially in the last few
decades CFCs were not pieseni in the atmosphere until the 1930s

3.2.2           Four scenarios o f future human-made emissions
were developed by W o r k i n g G r o u p III. The first o f these
assumes that few or no steps are taken to limit greenhouse
gas emissions, and this is therefore termed Business-as-
Usual ( B a U ) . (It should be noted that an aggregation o f
national forecasts o f emissions o f carbon d i o x i d e and
methane to the year 2025 undertaken by W o r k i n g Group III
resulted in global emissions 10-20% higher than in the B a U
s c e n a r i o . ) T h e other three s c e n a r i o s assume that
progressively increasing levels of controls reduce the growth
of emissions; these are referred to as scenarios B , C . and D .                                                                   SCENARIO D

        What tools do we use to predict future climate, and how do we use them?
    The most highly developed tool which we have to predict future climate is known as a general circulation model or
    G C M . Such models are based on the laws of physics and use descriptions in simplified physical terms (called
    parameterisations) of the smaller-scale processes such as those due to clouds and deep mixing in the ocean. In a climate
    model an atmospheric component, essentially the same as a weather prediction model, is coupled to a model o f the
    ocean, which can be equally complex.


    Climate forecasts are derived in a different way from weather forecasts. A weather prediction model gives a
    description of the atmosphere's state up to 10 days or so ahead, starting from a detailed description of an initial state
    of the atmosphere at a given time. Such forecasts describe the movement and development of large weather systems,
    though they cannot represent very small scale phenomena; for example, individual shower clouds.


    To make a climate forecast, the climate model is first run for a few (simulated) decades. The statistics o f the model's
    output is a description o f the model's simulated climate w h i c h , i f the model is a good one, w i l l bear a close
    resemblance to the climate o f the real atmosphere and ocean. The above exercise is then repeated with increasing
    concentrations of the greenhouse gases in the model. The differences between the statistics of the two simulations
    (for example in mean temperature and interannual variability) provide an estimate o f the accompanying climate change.


    The long-term change in surface air temperature following a doubling of carbon dioxide (referred to as the climate
    sensitivity) is generally used as a benchmark to compare models. The range o f results from model studies is 1.9 to
    5.2°C. Most results are close to 4 . 0 ° C but recent studies using a more detailed but not necessarily more accurate
    representation of cloud processes give results in the lower half of this range. Hence the models results do not justify
    altering the previously accepted range o f 1.5 to 4 . 5 ° C .


   Although scientists are reluctant to give a single best estimate in this range, it is necessary for the presentation of climate
   predictions for a choice of best estimate to be made. Taking into account the model results, together with observational
   evidence over the last century which is suggestive o f the climate sensitivity being in the lower half o f the range, (see
   section: "Has man already begun to change global climate?") a value of climate sensitivity of 2.5°C has been chosen
   as the best estimate.


   In this Assessment, we have also used much simpler models, which simulate the behaviour of G C M s , to make
   predictions o f the evolution with time of global temperature from a number o f emission scenarios. These so-called
   box-diffusion models contain highly simplified physics but give similar results to G C M s when globally averaged.


   A completely different, and potentially useful, way of predicting pattems of future climate is to search for periods in
   the past when the global mean temperatures were similar to those we expect in future, and then use the past spatial
   pattems as analogueues of those which will arise in the future. For a good analogueue, it is also necessary for the forcing
   factors (for example, greenhouse gases, orbital variations) and other conditions (for example, ice cover, topography,
   etc.) to be similar: direct comparisons with climate situations for which these conditions do not apply cannot be easily
   i n t e ф r e t e d . Analogueues of future greenhouse-gas-changed climates have not been found.


   We cannot therefore advocate the use of palaeo-climates as predictions o f regional climate change due to future
   increases in greenhouse gases. However, palaeo-climatological information can provide useful insights into climate
   processes, and can assist in the validation o f climate models.

                                          Equilibrium and realized climate change
    When the radiative forcing on the earth-atmosphere system is changed, for example by increasing greenhouse gas
    concentrations, the atmosphere w i l l try to respond (by warming) immediately. But the atmosphere is closely coupled
    to the oceans, so in order for the air to be warmed by the greenhouse effect, the oceans also have to be warmed; because
    of their thermal capacity this takes decades or centuries. This exchange o f heat between atmosphere and ocean w i l l
    act to slow down the temperature rise forced by the greenhouse effect.


    In a hypothetical example where the concentration o f greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, following a period of
    constancy, rises suddenly to a new level and remains there, the radiative forcing would also rise rapidly to a new level.
    This increased radiative forcing would cause the atmosphere and oceans to warm, and eventually come to a new, stable,
    temperature. A commitment to this equilibrium temperature rise is incurred as soon as the greenhouse gas concentration
    changes. But at any time before equilibrium is reached, the actual temperature w i l l have risen by only part o f the
    equilibrium temperature change, known as the realized temperature change.


    Models predict that, for the present day case o f an increase in radiative forcing which is approximately steady, the
    realized temperature rise at any time is about 5 0 % of the committed temperature rise i f the climate sensitivity (the
    response to a doubling o f carbon dioxide) is 4 . 5 ° C and about 80% i f the climate sensitivity is 1.5°C. If the forcing
    were then held constant, temperatures would continue to rise slowly, but it is not certain whether it would take decades
    or centuries for most o f the remaining rise to equilibrium to occur.

                           ( I P C C Business-as-Usual scenario: changes from pre-industrial)

The numbers given below are based on high resolution models, scaled to be consistent with our best estimate of global
mean wanning o f 1.8°C by 2030. For values consistent with other estimates of global temperature rise, the numbers
below should be reduced by 30% for the low estimate or increased by 50% for the high estimate. Precipitation estimates
are also scaled in a similar way.


                               Confidence in these regional estimates is low

Central North America (35°—50°N                   85°—105°W)
The warming varies from 2 to 4 ° C in winter and 2 to 3 ° C in summer. Precipitation increases range from 0 to 15%
in winter whereas there are decreases of 5 to 10% in summer. Soil moisture decreases in summer by 15 to 20%.


Southern Asia (5°—30°N               70°—l05°E)
The warming varies from 1 to 2 ° C throughout the year. Precipitation changes little in winter and generally increases
throughout the region by 5 to 15% in summer. Summer soil moisture increases by 5 to 10%.


Sahel (10°—20°N            20°W—40°E)
The warming ranges from 1 to 3 ° C . Area mean precipitation increases and area mean soil moisture decreases
marginally in summer. However, throughout the region, there are areas o f both increase and decrease in both
parameters.


Southern Europe (35°—50°N                  10°W—45°E)
The warming is about 2 ° C in winter and varies from 2 to 3 ° C in summer. There is some indication o f increased
precipitation in winter, but summer precipitation decreases by 5 to 15%, and summer soil moisture by 15 to 25%.


Australia (12°-^5°S           J10°—115°E)
The warming ranges from 1 to 2 ° C in summer and is about 2 ° C in winter. Summer precipitation increases by around
10%, but the models do not produce consistent estimates o f the changes in soil moisture. The area averages hide large
variations at the sub-contmental level.

                                    Confídence in predictions from climate models
    What confidence can we have that climate change due to increasing greenhouse gases will look anything like the model
    predictions? Weather forecasts can be compared with the actual weather the next day and their skill assessed; we cannot
    do that with climate predictions. However, there are several indicators that give us some confidence in the predictions
    from climate models.


    When the latest atmospheric models are run with the present atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and
    observed boundary conditions their simulation of present climate is generally realistic on large scales, capturing the
    major features such as the wet tropical convergence zones and mid-latitude depression belts, as well as the contrasts
    between summer and winter circulations. The models also simulate the observed variability: for example, the large
    day-to-day pressure variations in the middle latitude depression belts and the maxima in interannual variability
    responsible for the very different character o f one winter from another both being represented. However, on regional
    scales (2,000 km or less), there are significant errors in all models.


    Overall confidence is increased by atmospheric models' generally satisfactory portrayal of aspects of variability o f
    the atmosphere, for instance those associated with variations in sea surface temperature. There has been some
    success in simulating the general circulation of the ocean, including the pattems (though not always the intensities)
    of the principal currents, and the distributions of tracers added to the ocean.


    Atmospheric models have been coupled with simple models o f the ocean to predict the equilibrium response to
    greenhouse gases, under the assumption that the model errors are the same in a changed climate. The ability o f such
    models to simulate important aspects of the climate o f the last ice age generates confidence in their usefulness.
    Atmospheric models have also been coupled with multilayer ocean models (to give coupled ocean-atmosphere
    G C M s ) which predict the gradual response to increasing greenhouse gases. Although the models so far are o f
    relatively coarse resolution, the large scale structures of the ocean and the atmosphere can be simulated with some
    s k i l l . However, the coupling o f ocean and atmosphere models reveals a strong sensitivity to small scale errors which
    leads to a drift away from the observed climate. A s yet, these errors must be removed by adjustments to the exchange
    of heat between ocean and atmosphere. There are similarities between results from the coupled models using simple
    representations of the ocean and those using more sophisticated descriptions, and our understanding of such differences
    as do occur gives us some confidence in the results.

                                          Deforestation and reforestation
   M a n has been deforesting the Earth for millennia. Until the early part o f the century, this was mainly in temperate
   regions, more recently it has been concentrated in the tropics. Deforestation has several potential impacts on climate:
   through the carbon and nitrogen cycles (where it can lead to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations),
   through the change in reflectivity o f terrain when forests are cleared, through'its effect on the hydrological cycle
   (precipitation, evaporation and runoff) and surface roughness and thus atmospheric circulation which can produce
   remote effects on climate.

   It is estimated that each year about 2 G t o f carbon ( G t C ) is released to the atmosphere due to tropical deforestation.
   The rate o f forest clearing is difficult to estimate: probably until the mid-20th century, temperate deforestation and
   the loss o f organic matter from soils was a more important contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide than was the
   buming of fossil fuels. Since then, fossil fuels have become dominant: one estimate is that around 1980, 1.6 G t C was
   being released annually from the clearing o f tropical forests, compared with about 5 G t C from the burning o f fossil
   fuels. If all the tropical forests were removed, the input is variously estimated at from 150 to 240 G t C ; this would
   increase atmospheric carbon dioxide by 35 to 60 ppmv.


   T o analyse the effect o f reforestation we assume that 10 m i l l i o n hectares o f forests are planted each year for a period
   of 40 years, i.e.. 4 million k m - would then have been planted by 2030, at which time 1 G t C would be absorbed annually
   until these forests reach maturity. This would happen in 40—100 years for most forests. The above scenario implies
   an accumulated uptake o f about 2 0 G t C by the year 2030 and up to 8 0 G t C after 100 years. This accumulation o f carbon
   in forests is equivalent to some 5-10% o f the emission due to fossil fuel buming in the Business-as-Usual scenario.


   Deforestation can also alter climate directly by increasing reflectivity and decreasing évapotranspiration. Experiments
   with climate models predict that replacing all the forests o f the A m a z o n Basin by grassland would reduce the rainfall
   over the basin by about 20%, and increase mean temperature by several degrees.

Potential Impacts of Climate Change



                               Estimates for regional changes by Working Group I
                                ( I P C C Business-as-Usual scenario; changes from pre-industrial)


   The estimates are based on high resolution models, scaled to give a global mean warming of 1.8°C consistent with the best
   estimate (2.5°C) of climate response to greenhouse gases. With the low estimate of 1.5°C, these values should be reduced
   by 30%; with the high estimate of 4.5°C. they should be increased by 50%. Confidence in these regional estimates is low.


   Central North America (35°-50°N                    85°-J05°W)
   The warming varies from 2 to 4 ° C in winter and 2 to 3°C in summer. Precipitation increases range from 0 to 15% in winter
   whereas there are decreases of 5 to 10% in summer. Soil moisture decreases in summer by 15 to 20%.

   Southern Asia (5°-30°N               70°-105°E)
   The warming varies from 1 to 2°C throughout the year. Precipitation changes little in winter and generally increases
   throughout the region by 5 to 15% in summer. Summer soil moisture increases by 5 to 10%.

   Sahel (]0°-20°N           20°W-40°E)
   The wanning ranges from 1 to 3°C. Area mean precipitation increases and area mean soil moisture decreases marginally
   in summer. However, throughout the region, there are areas of both increase and decrease in both parameters throughout
   the region.

   Southern Europe (35°-50°N                W°W- 45°E)
   The warming is about 2°C in winter and varies from 2 to 3°C in summer. There is some indication of increased precipitation
   in winter, but summer precipitation decreases by 5 to 15%, and summer soil moisture by 15 to 25%.

   Australia (12°-45°S           IJ0°-IJ5°E)
   The warming ranges from 1 to 2°C in summer and is about 2°C in winter. Summer precipitation increases by around 10%,
   but the models do not produce consistent estimates of the changes in soil moisture. The area averages hide large variations
   at the sub-continental level.

the impact of possible response strategies (developed by Working

energy production from fossil fuel to nuclear or renewable
energy sources could drastically alter our assessments. Further,
changes in agricultural practice could dramatically alter yields
of particular crops in certain regions. These impacts of response
strategies require much additional work.

9.0.1       Human-induced climate change can have profound
consequences for the worid's social, economic and natural
systems. Each country should take steps to understand the
impacts on its population and land resources resulting from
such a change, and the consequences of sea-level rise, the
changed character o f atmospheric c i r c u l a t i o n and the
resulting changes in typical weather pattems, reduction o f
freshwater resources, increased ultraviolet-B radiation and
spreading o f pests and diseases.                These can affect the

International cooperation
 12.           The measures noted above require a high degree of
international cooperation with due respect for national
sovereignty of states. The international negotiation on a
framework convention should start as quickly as possible
after the completion of the I P C C First Assessment Report.
This, together with any additional protocols that might be
agreed upon, w o u l d provide a firm basis for effective
cooperation to act on greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to
any adverse effects o f climate change. The convention
s h o u l d , at a m i n i m u m , contain general principles and
obligations. It should be framed in such a way as to gain the
adherence of the largest possible number and most suitably
balanced range of countries while permitting timely action
to be taken.

t i m i n g , legal form and incidence o f any obligations to
control the net emissions o f greenhouse gases, how to
address equitably the consequences for all, any institutional
mechanisms that may be required, the need for research

developing countries for additional financial resources and
for the transfer of technology on a preferential basis.

- The estimates for emissions of C F C s in 1985 and 2025 reflect the decisions taken at the meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol
in London in June 1990. At that meeting, the parties agreed to accelerate the phase out of the production and consumption of CFCs, halons,
carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform.

3. The paper points out a number o f issues to be decided in
the negotiation o f a Convention. In general these are:


       the political imperative of striking the correct balances:
       on the one hand, between the arguments for a far-
       reaching, action-oriented Convention and the need for
       urgent adoption o f such a Convention so as to begin
       tackling the problem o f climate change: and, on the
       other hand, between the cost o f inaction and the lack
       of scientific certainty;


       the extent to which specific obligations, particularly on
       the control o f emissions o f carbon dioxide and other
       greenhouse gases, s h o u l d be i n c l u d e d i n the
       C o n v e n t i o n i t s e l f o r be the subject o f separate

Annexes and protocols
The negotiating parties may wish the Convention to provide
for the possibility o f annexes and/or protocols. Annexes
might be concluded as integral parts o f the Convention,
while protocols might be concluded subsequently (as in the
case of the Montreal Protocol to the V i e n n a Convention on
Protection o f the Ozone Layer). W h i l e it is recognized that
the Convention is to be all-encompassing, the negotiating
parties w i l l have to decide whether greenhouse gases, their
sources and sinks, are to be dealt with: individually, i n
groups or comprehensively; in annexes or protocols to the
Convention. The following, among others, might also be
considered as possible subjects for annexes or protocols to
the Convention:


      agricultural practices;


      forest management;


      funding mechanisms;


      research and systematic observations;


      energy conservation and alternative sources o f energy;


•     liability and compensation;


      intemational emissions trading;


      intemational taxation system;

      development and transfer o f climate change-related
      technologies.

•     Issues that w i l l arise i n c o n n e c t i o n w i t h the

a.     The I P C C budget is in Swiss francs (SFr) since this is the currency of the W M O budget. The joint W M O / U N E P I P C C
       Trust Fund is administered by the Secretary-General of W M O in accordance with W M O Financial Regulations.


b.     The amount contributed exclusively for travel support to developing countries in 1989 was S F r 182,000. M a n y
       contributors gave flexibility to the I P C C Secretariat on expenditures, while all affirmed their desire that at least part
       of their contributions should be spent on travel support to developing countries to attend I P C C meetings.


c.     One-half o f the 1989 expenditures in the I P C C Trust Fund was devoted to the travel support of the developing countries.

d.     The 1989 account o f the I P C C Trust Fund showed a s u ф l u s which was carried over to 1990. Nevertheless, the Fund
       was experiencing acute and continuing cash shortages throughout 1989.


e.     The Government o f N o r w a y has given N k r 700,000 to the I P C C Secretariat for organizing an information exchange
       seminar for the developing countries on climate change issues. This has not been shown in the table, since this
       contribution is through a special Memorandum o f Understanding and not to the Trust Fund.


In this connection, it may be noted that several countries are planning regional seminars on the same and related topics. These
countries are:


       France: Seminar on greenhouse warming in late 1990/early 1991 jointly with the Energy and Industry Office o f U N E P ;


       Japan:      Seminar on the environment and fossil fuel consumption in the Pacific R e g i o n , mid-December 1990;
       information exchange seminar for the developing countries in A s i a at the end o f January 1991;


       Spain: Seminar for the Spanish-speaking developing countries in the third quarter o f 1990;


       Australia: possible joint seminar with the E c o n o m i c and Social C o m m i s s i o n for A s i a and the Pacific ( E S C A P ) .
