T   he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the
     United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:

Climate Change 2007 – Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the IPCC. It
provides an integrated view of climate change and addresses the following topics:
• Observed changes in climate and their effects
• Causes of change
• Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
• Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the interrelationship with sustainable development, at global and
   regional levels
• The long-term perspective: scientific and socio-economic aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation, consistent with the
   objectives and provisions of the Convention, and in the context of sustainable development
• Robust findings, key uncertainties

over the period 1970-2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the
following criteria: (1) ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction,
as assessed in individual studies. These data series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about
29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to
estimate a temperature trend. The 2 × 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of
those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR),
Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and
Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, EUR, AFR, AS, ANZ, PR) do not add up to the global (GLO) totals
because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems. Locations of large-
area marine changes are not shown on the map. {Figure 1.2}

  Increases in GHGs tend to warm the surface while the net effect of increases in aerosols tends to cool it. The net effect due to human activities
since the pre-industrial era is one of warming (+1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W/m2). In comparison, changes in solar irradiance are estimated to have
caused a small warming effect (+0.12 [+0.06 to +0.30] W/m2).

best estimate (solid line within each bar) and the likely range assessed for the six SRES marker scenarios at 2090-2099. All temperatures are
relative to the period 1980-1999. {Figures 3.1 and 3.2}

additional climate policies above current ones; more recent studies differ with respect to UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol inclusion.

     Notes:
     a) Temperatures are assessed best estimates and likely uncertainty ranges from a hierarchy of models of varying complexity as well as
        observational constraints.
     b) Year 2000 constant composition is derived from Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) only.
     c) All scenarios above are six SRES marker scenarios. Approximate CO2-eq concentrations corresponding to the computed radiative
        forcing due to anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols in 2100 (see p. 823 of the Working Group I TAR) for the SRES B1, AIT, B2, A1B, A2
        and A1FI illustrative marker scenarios are about 600, 700, 800, 850, 1250 and 1550ppm, respectively.
     d) Temperature changes are expressed as the difference from the period 1980-1999. To express the change relative to the period 1850-
        1899 add 0.5°C.

 Africa               By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to
                       climate change.
                      By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural
                       production, including access to food, in many African countries is projected to be severely compromised. This
                       would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition.
                      Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea level rise will affect low-lying coastal areas with large
                       populations. The cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
                      By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in Africa is projected under a range of climate
                       scenarios (TS).

                       basins, is projected to decrease.
                      Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at
                       greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding from the rivers.
                      Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natural resources and the environment
                       associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development.
                      Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts
                       are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle.

 Australia and        By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the
 New Zealand           Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics.
                      By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in southern and eastern Australia and, in
                       New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions.
                      By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected to decline over much of southern and
                       eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire. However, in
                       New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in some other regions.
                      By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia and New Zealand
                       are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms
                       and coastal flooding.

 Europe               Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe’s natural resources and assets.
                       Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequent coastal flooding and
                       increased erosion (due to storminess and sea level rise).
                      Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species
                       losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080).
                      In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in
                       a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential,
                       summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity.
                      Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires.

 Latin America        By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to
                       gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to
                       be replaced by arid-land vegetation.
                      There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America.
                      Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with
                       adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are projected to increase.
                       Overall, the number of people at risk of hunger is projected to increase (TS; medium confidence).
                      Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect
                       water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.

 North America        Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and
                       reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources.
                      In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of
                       rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are
                       projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised
                       water resources.
                      Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased
                       number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse
                       health impacts.
                      Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting
                       with development and pollution.

Summary for Policymakers



Table SPM.2. continued...

 Polar Regions          The main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thickness and extent of glaciers, ice sheets
                         and sea ice, and changes in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organisms including
                         migratory birds, mammals and higher predators.
                        For human communities in the Arctic, impacts, particularly those resulting from changing snow and ice
                         conditions, are projected to be mixed.
                        Detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and traditional indigenous ways of life.
                        In both polar regions, specific ecosystems and habitats are projected to be vulnerable, as climatic barriers to
                         species invasions are lowered.

  Small Islands         Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus
                         threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities.
                        Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected
                         to affect local resources.
                        By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g. in
                         the Caribbean and Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall
                         periods.
                        With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur, particularly on
                         mid- and high-latitude islands.

SPM.6). The temperature scale has been shifted by -0.5°C compared to Table SPM.6 to account approximately for the warming between pre-
industrial and 1980-1999. For most stabilisation levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For
GHG emissions scenarios that lead to stabilisation at levels comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850ppm CO2-eq; category IV
and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated global equilibrium temperature increase, assuming a climate sensitivity
of 3°C, would be realised at the time of stabilisation. For the much lower stabilisation scenarios (category I and II, Figure SPM.11), the equilib-
rium temperature may be reached earlier. {Figure 3.4}

 While this Section deals with adaptation and mitigation separately, these responses can be complementary. This theme is discussed in
Section 5.

  The concept of ‘mitigation potential’ has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission
baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation
potential is further differentiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.
     Market mitigation potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private
     consumers and companies), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in
     place, noting that barriers limit actual uptake.
     Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflect-
     ing the perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors), assuming that market efficiency is
     improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed.
     Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options,
     emphasising specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down
     studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about
     mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks.

Figure SPM.9. Global economic mitigation potential in 2030 estimated from bottom-up (Panel a) and top-down (Panel b) studies, compared with
the projected emissions increases from SRES scenarios relative to year 2000 GHG emissions of 40.8 GtCO2-eq (Panel c). Note: GHG emissions
in 2000 are exclusive of emissions of decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation and from peat fires and
drained peat soils, to ensure consistency with the SRES emission results. {Figure 4.1}

Figure SPM.10. Estimated economic mitigation potential by sector in 2030 from bottom-up studies, compared to the respective baselines
assumed in the sector assessments. The potentials do not include non-technical options such as lifestyle changes. {Figure 4.2}
Notes:
a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
   emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.
b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.
c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry, the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport, the World Energy Outlook
   (WEO) 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving
   forces were used to construct a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.
d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.
e) Categories excluded are: non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and co-genera-
   tion in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewa-
   ter treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underes-
   timation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

   Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a
global least-cost approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and
thus perfect implementation of mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled
costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g. land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower
baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider
climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying ap-
proaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies; however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced
technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.

  Key vulnerabilities can be identified based on a number of criteria in the literature, including magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the
potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and ‘importance’ of the impacts.

     Notes:
     a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underesti-
        mated due to missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).
     b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived
        GHGs is about 455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq.
     c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios
        can be compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure SPM.3).
     d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.
     e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of
        GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentra-
        tions occurs between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 21).
     f) Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many
        centuries. These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs
        based on the best estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps.
        Long-term thermal expansion is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial.
        (AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)



21
  Estimates for the evolution of temperature over the course of this century are not available in the AR4 for the stabilisation scenarios. For most
stabilisation levels, global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For the much lower stabilisation
scenarios (category I and II, Figure SPM.11), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier.

Coloured shadings show stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel
shows ranges of global average temperature change above pre-industrial, using (i) ‘best estimate’ climate sensitivity of 3°C (black line in middle
of shaded area), (ii) upper bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 4.5°C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of
climate sensitivity of 2°C (blue line at bottom of shaded area). Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline
scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emissions ranges of the stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multigas scenarios and
correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2 emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay
of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation, and from peat fires and drained peat soils. {Figure 5.1}

     Treatment of uncertainty
        The IPCC uncertainty guidance note1 defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all WGs and in this Synthesis Report.
     This framework is broad because the WGs assess material from different disciplines and cover a diversity of approaches to the treatment of
     uncertainty drawn from the literature. The nature of data, indicators and analyses used in the natural sciences is generally different from that
     used in assessing technology development or the social sciences. WG I focuses on the former, WG III on the latter, and WG II covers aspects
     of both.
        Three different approaches are used to describe uncertainties each with a distinct form of language. Choices among and within these three
     approaches depend on both the nature of the information available and the authors’ expert judgment of the correctness and completeness of
     current scientific understanding.
         Where uncertainty is assessed qualitatively, it is characterised by providing a relative sense of the amount and quality of evidence (that is,
     information from theory, observations or models indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid) and the degree of agreement (that is,
     the level of concurrence in the literature on a particular finding). This approach is used by WG III through a series of self-explanatory terms
     such as: high agreement, much evidence; high agreement, medium evidence; medium agreement, medium evidence; etc.
        Where uncertainty is assessed more quantitatively using expert judgement of the correctness of underlying data, models or analyses, then
     the following scale of confidence levels is used to express the assessed chance of a finding being correct: very high confidence at least 9 out
     of 10; high confidence about 8 out of 10; medium confidence about 5 out of 10; low confidence about 2 out of 10; and very low confidence less
     than 1 out of 10.
        Where uncertainty in specific outcomes is assessed using expert judgment and statistical analysis of a body of evidence (e.g. observations
     or model results), then the following likelihood ranges are used to express the assessed probability of occurrence: virtually certain >99%;
     extremely likely >95%; very likely >90%; likely >66%; more likely than not > 50%; about as likely as not 33% to 66%; unlikely <33%; very
     unlikely <10%; extremely unlikely <5%; exceptionally unlikely <1%.
        WG II has used a combination of confidence and likelihood assessments and WG I has predominantly used likelihood assessments.
        This Synthesis Report follows the uncertainty assessment of the underlying WGs. Where synthesised findings are based on information
     from more than one WG, the description of uncertainty used is consistent with that for the components drawn from the respective WG reports.
        Unless otherwise stated, numerical ranges given in square brackets in this report indicate 90% uncertainty intervals (i.e. there is an
     estimated 5% likelihood that the value could be above the range given in square brackets and 5% likelihood that the value could be below that
     range). Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric around the best estimate.

Figure 1.2. Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and
biological systems (terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-
2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the following criteria: (1) ending in 1990
or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies. These data
series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European
studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend. The 2 x 2 boxes show the total number of data
series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM),
Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial
(TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, …, PR) do not add up to the global
(GLO) totals because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems. Locations of large-
area marine changes are not shown on the map. {WGII Figure SPM.1, Figure 1.8, Figure 1.9; WGI Figure 3.9b}

  Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system and
is an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. In this report radiative forcing values are for changes relative to pre-
industrial conditions defined at 1750 and are expressed in watts per square metre (W/m2).

2000 and 2030. In these scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to
maintain their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030
and beyond. Hence CO2 emissions from energy use between 2000
and 2030 are projected to grow 40 to 110% over that period. {WGIII

     SRES scenarios
     SRES refers to the scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000). The SRES scenarios are
     grouped into four scenario families (A1, A2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range of
     demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting GHG emissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additional
     climate policies above current ones. The emissions projections are widely used in the assessments of future climate change, and their
     underlying assumptions with respect to socio-economic, demographic and technological change serve as inputs to many recent climate
     change vulnerability and impact assessments. {WGI 10.1; WGII 2.4; WGIII TS.1, SPM}
        The A1 storyline assumes a world of very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks in mid-century and rapid introduc-
     tion of new and more efficient technologies. A1 is divided into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change:
     fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all sources (A1B). B1 describes a convergent world,
     with the same global population as A1, but with more rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy.
     B2 describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, emphasising local solutions to economic, social, and environ-
     mental sustainability. A2 describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic development and slow
     technological change. No likelihood has been attached to any of the SRES scenarios. {WGIII TS.1, SPM}

  Since the TAR, there has been a debate on the use of different exchange rates in emissions scenarios. Two metrics are used to compare GDP between
countries. Use of MER is preferable for analyses involving internationally traded products. Use of PPP is preferable for analyses involving comparisons of
income between countries at very different stages of development. Most of the monetary units in this report are expressed in MER. This reflects the large
majority of emissions mitigation literature that is calibrated in MER. When monetary units are expressed in PPP, this is denoted by GDPPPP. {WGIII SPM}

     Notes:
     a) These estimates are assessed from a hierarchy of models that encompass a simple climate model, several Earth Models of Intermediate
        Complexity, and a large number of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) as well as observational constraints.
     b) Year 2000 constant composition is derived from AOGCMs only.
     c) All scenarios above are six SRES marker scenarios. Approximate CO2-eq concentrations corresponding to the computed radiative forcing due to
        anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols in 2100 (see p. 823 of the WGI TAR) for the SRES B1, AIT, B2, A1B, A2 and A1FI illustrative marker scenarios
        are about 600, 700, 800, 850, 1250 and 1550ppm, respectively.
     d) Temperature changes are expressed as the difference from the period 1980-1999. To express the change relative to the period 1850-1899 add
        0.5°C.

  TAR projections were made for 2100, whereas the projections for this report are for 2090-2099. The TAR would have had similar ranges to those in

comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850 ppm CO2-eq; category IV and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated

  Climate change and water
     Climate change is expected to exacerbate current stresses on water resources from population growth and economic and land-use
  change, including urbanisation. On a regional scale, mountain snow pack, glaciers and small ice caps play a crucial role in freshwater
  availability. Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate
  throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by
  meltwater from major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes), where more than one-sixth of the world population cur-
  rently lives. {WGI 4.1, 4.5; WGII 3.3, 3.4, 3.5}
     Changes in precipitation (Figure 3.3) and temperature (Figure 3.2) lead to changes in runoff (Figure 3.5) and water availability.
  Runoff is projected with high confidence to increase by 10 to 40% by mid-century at higher latitudes and in some wet tropical areas,
  including populous areas in East and South-East Asia, and decrease by 10 to 30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and dry
  tropics, due to decreases in rainfall and higher rates of evapotranspiration. There is also high confidence that many semi-arid areas
  (e.g. the Mediterranean Basin, western United States, southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water re-
  sources due to climate change. Drought-affected areas are projected to increase in extent, with the potential for adverse impacts on
  multiple sectors, e.g. agriculture, water supply, energy production and health. Regionally, large increases in irrigation water demand as
  a result of climate changes are projected. {WGI 10.3, 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.4, 3.5, Figure 3.5, TS.4.1, Box TS.5, SPM}
     The negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh its benefits (high confidence). Areas in which runoff is
  projected to decline face a reduction in the value of the services provided by water resources (very high confidence). The beneficial
  impacts of increased annual runoff in some areas are likely to be tempered by negative effects of increased precipitation variability and
  seasonal runoff shifts on water supply, water quality and flood risk. {WGII 3.4, 3.5, TS.4.1}
      Available research suggests a significant future increase in heavy rainfall events in many regions, including some in which the mean
  rainfall is projected to decrease. The resulting increased flood risk poses challenges to society, physical infrastructure and water quality.
  It is likely that up to 20% of the world population will live in areas where river flood potential could increase by the 2080s. Increases in
  the frequency and severity of floods and droughts are projected to adversely affect sustainable development. Increased temperatures
  will further affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of freshwater lakes and rivers, with predominantly adverse impacts on
  many individual freshwater species, community composition and water quality. In coastal areas, sea level rise will exacerbate water
  resource constraints due to increased salinisation of groundwater supplies. {WGI 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4}


                    Projections and model consistency of relative changes in runoff by the end of the 21st century




  Figure 3.5. Large-scale relative changes in annual runoff (water availability, in percent) for the period 2090-2099, relative to 1980-1999. Values
  represent the median of 12 climate models using the SRES A1B scenario. White areas are where less than 66% of the 12 models agree on the sign of
  change and hatched areas are where more than 90% of models agree on the sign of change. The quality of the simulation of the observed large-scale
  20th century runoff is used as a basis for selecting the 12 models from the multi-model ensemble. The global map of annual runoff illustrates a large
  scale and is not intended to refer to smaller temporal and spatial scales. In areas where rainfall and runoff is very low (e.g. desert areas), small changes
  in runoff can lead to large percentage changes. In some regions, the sign of projected changes in runoff differs from recently observed trends. In some
  areas with projected increases in runoff, different seasonal effects are expected, such as increased wet season runoff and decreased dry season
  runoff. Studies using results from few climate models can be considerably different from the results presented here. {WGII Figure 3.4, adjusted to match

climate changes (and sea level and atmospheric CO 2 where relevant) associated with different amounts of increase in global average surface temperature
in the 21st century. The black lines link impacts; broken-line arrows indicate impacts continuing with increasing temperature. Entries are placed so that the
left-hand side of text indicates the approximate level of warming that is associated with the onset of a given impact. Quantitative entries for water scarcity and
flooding represent the additional impacts of climate change relative to the conditions projected across the range of SRES scenarios A1FI, A2, B1 and B2.
Adaptation to climate change is not included in these estimations. Confidence levels for all statements are high. The upper right panel gives the WG II

Figure 4.1. Global economic mitigation potential in 2030 estimated from bottom-up (Panel a) and top-down (Panel b) studies, compared with the projected
emissions increases from SRES scenarios relative to year 2000 GHG emissions of 40.8 GtCO2-eq (Panel c). Note: GHG emissions in 2000 are exclusive of
emissions of decay of above-ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation and from peat fires and drained peat soils, to ensure consistency
with the SRES emissions results. {WGIII Figures SPM.4, SPM.5a, SPM.5b}

   The concept of ‘mitigation potential’ has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for
a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differen-
tiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.
   Market mitigation potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private consumers
   and companies ), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that
   barriers limit actual uptake.
   Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflecting the
   perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors ), assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and
   measures and barriers are removed.
   Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasising
   specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down studies assess the
   economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture
   macro-economic and market feedbacks.
22
  Net negative costs (no regrets opportunities) are defined as those options whose benefits such as reduced energy costs and reduced emissions of local/
regional pollutants equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change.

do not include non-technical options such as lifestyle changes. {WGIII Figure SPM.6}
Notes:
a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
   emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.
b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.
c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2004
   baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct
   a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.
d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.
e) Categories excluded are non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy
   supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission
   reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential
   from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

  Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least-cost
approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thus perfect implementation of
mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g.
land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned
permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation
measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies;
however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the
reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.

     Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of the UNFCCC
     Article 2 of the UNFCCC states:
        “The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to
     achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmo-
     sphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved
     within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened
     and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”
        Determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” in relation to Article 2 of the UNFCCC
     involves value judgements. Science can support informed decisions on this issue, including by providing criteria for judging which
     vulnerabilities might be labelled ‘key’. {SYR 3.3, WGII 19.ES}
        Key vulnerabilities25 may be associated with many climate-sensitive systems, including food supply, infrastructure, health, water
     resources, coastal systems, ecosystems, global biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets and modes of oceanic and atmospheric circulation.
     {WGII 19.ES}
        More specific information is now available across the regions of the world concerning the nature of future impacts, including for some
     places not covered in previous assessments. {WGII SPM}



25
  Key Vulnerabilities can be identified based on a number of criteria in the literature, including magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the
potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and ‘importance’ of the impacts.

     hand panel). Approaching equilibrium can take several centuries, especially for scenarios with higher levels of stabilisation. Coloured shadings show
     stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel shows ranges of global average tempera-

     climate sensitivity of 4.5°C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 2°C (blue line at bottom of shaded area).
     Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emissions ranges of the
     stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multigas scenarios and correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2
     emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation, and from peat fires
     and drained peat soils. {WGIII Figures SPM.7 and SPM.8}

                         Peaking means that the emissions need to reach a maximum before they decline later.
     29
       For the lowest mitigation scenario category assessed, emissions would need to peak by 2015 and for the highest by 2090 (see Table 5.1). Scenarios that
     use alternative emission pathways show substantial differences on the rate of global climate change. {WGII 19.4}

     Notes:
     a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated due to
        missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).
     b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO 2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived GHGs is about
        455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq.
     c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85 th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be
        compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure 2.1).
     d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.
     e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of GHG
        concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs
        between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 30).
     f) Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many centuries.
        These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs based on the best
        estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps. Long-term thermal expansion
        is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial. (AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean
        General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)

   Estimates for the evolution of temperature over the course of this century are not available in the AR4 for the stabilisation scenarios. For most stabilisation
levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For the much lower stabilisation scenarios (category I and II,

  To stabilise at 1000ppm CO2, this feedback could require that cumulative emissions be reduced from a model average of approximately 5190 [4910 to

figure shows illustrative scenarios from four models (AIM, IMAGE, IPAC and MESSAGE) aiming at the stabilisation at low (490 to 540ppm CO2-eq) and
intermediate levels (650ppm CO2-eq) respectively. Dark bars denote reductions for a target of 650ppm CO2-eq and light bars denote the additional reduc-
tions to achieve 490 to 540ppm CO2-eq. Note that some models do not consider mitigation through forest sink enhancement (AIM and IPAC) or CCS (AIM)
and that the share of low-carbon energy options in total energy supply is also determined by inclusion of these options in the baseline. CCS includes CO2
capture and storage from biomass. Forest sinks include reducing emissions from deforestation. The figure shows emissions reductions from baseline
scenarios with cumulative emissions between 6000 to 7000 GtCO2-eq (2000-2100). {WGIII Figure SPM.9}

     a) Global GDP based on market exchange rates.
     b) The 10th and 90th percentile range of the analysed data are given where applicable. Negative values indicate GDP gain. The first row (445-535ppm

     c) The calculation of the reduction of the annual growth rate is based on the average reduction during the assessed period that would result in the
         indicated GDP decrease by 2030 and 2050 respectively.
     d) The number of studies is relatively small and they generally use low baselines. High emissions baselines generally lead to higher costs.
     e) The values correspond to the highest estimate for GDP reduction shown in column three.

User guide and access to more detailed information
As defined in the IPCC Procedures, the Synthesis Report (SYR) synthesises and integrates material contained within IPCC Assessment
Reports and Special Reports. The scope of the SYR of the Fourth Assessment Report includes material contained in the three Working
Group contributions to the AR4, and it draws on information contained in other IPCC Reports as required. The SYR is based exclusively
on assessments by the IPCC Working Groups, it does not refer to or assess the primary scientific literature itself.

The SYR is largely self-contained but provides only a very condensed summary of the much richer information contained in the underlying
Working Group reports. Users may wish to access relevant material at the required level of detail in the following manner:

   The Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the SYR provides the most condensed summary of our current understanding of scientific,
    technical and socio-economic aspects of climate change. All references in curly brackets in this Summary for Policymakers refer to
    numbered sections of this SYR.

   The Introduction and six Topics of this SYR provide more detailed and more comprehensive information than the SYR SPM. Refer-
    ences in curly backets in the Introduction and six Topics of this SYR point to chapter sections, Summaries for Policymakers and
    Technical Summaries of the three underlying Working Group reports of the AR4, and in some instances to other topic sections of the
    SYR itself. References to the IPCC Third Assessment Report in 2001 (TAR) are identified by adding “TAR” in front of the cited report.

   Users who wish to gain a better understanding of scientific details or access the primary scientific literature on which the SYR is based,
    should refer to chapter sections of the underlying Working Group reports that are cited in the longer report of the SYR. The individual
    chapters of the Working Group reports provide comprehensive references to the primary scientific literature on which IPCC assess-
    ments are based, and also offer the most detailed region- and sector-specific information.

A comprehensive glossary, list of acronyms, abbreviations and scientific units, and an index are provided below to facilitate use of this
report by as wide an audience as possible.

Glossary
Editor: Alfons P. M. Baede (Netherlands)
Co-editors: Paul van der Linden (United Kingdom), Aviel Verbruggen (Belgium)

This Glossary is based on the glossaries published in the contributions of Working Groups of I, II and III to the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report. Additional work has been undertaken on additions, consistency and shortening of definitions to make this
glossary more suitable to a wider audience.
The italics used have the following meaning: Glossary word reference; Glossary secondary reference (i.e. terms which are either
contained in a glossary of the IPCC Working Group contributions to the AR4, or defined within the text of an entry of this glossary).

T   he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the
     United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:

Climate Change 2007 – Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the IPCC. It
provides an integrated view of climate change and addresses the following topics:
• Observed changes in climate and their effects
• Causes of change
• Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
• Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the interrelationship with sustainable development, at global and
   regional levels
• The long-term perspective: scientific and socio-economic aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation, consistent with the
   objectives and provisions of the Convention, and in the context of sustainable development
• Robust findings, key uncertainties
